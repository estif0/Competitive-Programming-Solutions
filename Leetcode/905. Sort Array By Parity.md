# Solution to [Sort Array By Parity](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

---

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea is to separate the even and odd numbers in the array and then concatenate the even numbers with the odd numbers. This ensures that all even numbers come before all odd numbers in the resulting array.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Iterate through the array and collect all even numbers.
2. **Step 2**: Iterate through the array again and collect all odd numbers.
3. **Step 3**: Concatenate the list of even numbers with the list of odd numbers to form the final sorted array.

> **Example**: Using list comprehensions to filter even and odd numbers, and then combining them.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The solution involves iterating through the array twice, which results in a linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - Additional space is used to store the even and odd numbers separately before combining them.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def sortArrayByParity(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
                even = [num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0]
                odd = [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
                return even + odd
```

---

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [3, 1, 2, 4]
Output = [2, 4, 3, 1]

# Test case 2
parameters = [0, 1, 2]
Output = [0, 2, 1]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: In-Place Two-Pointer Technique

- Use two pointers to partition the array in-place.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: No additional space required.
- Cons: Slightly more complex implementation.
  ```python
  class Solution:
          def sortArrayByParity(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
                  left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
                  while left < right:
                          if nums[left] % 2 != 0 and nums[right] % 2 == 0:
                                  nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]
                          if nums[left] % 2 == 0:
                                  left += 1
                          if nums[right] % 2 != 0:
                                  right -= 1
                  return nums
  ```

### Alternative 2: Sorting with Custom Comparator

- Use a custom comparator to sort the array such that even numbers come before odd numbers.
- **Complexity**: O(n log n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Simple to implement using built-in sort functions.
- Cons: Higher time complexity due to sorting.

  ```python
  class Solution:
          def sortArrayByParity(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
                  return sorted(nums, key=lambda x: x % 2)
  ```
