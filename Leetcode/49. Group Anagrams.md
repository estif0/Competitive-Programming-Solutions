# Solution to [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea is to group words that are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. By sorting each word, we can use the sorted word as a key to group all anagrams together.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Initialize an empty dictionary `anna` to store the groups of anagrams.
2. **Step 2**: Iterate through each word in the input list `strs`.
   - Sort the characters of the word to form the key `sWord`.
   - If `sWord` is already a key in `anna`, append the original word to the list corresponding to `sWord`.
   - If `sWord` is not a key, create a new entry in `anna` with `sWord` as the key and the original word as the value in a list.
3. **Step 3**: Return the list of values from the dictionary `anna`, which represents the grouped anagrams.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N \* K log K)
  - N is the number of words, and K is the maximum length of a word. Sorting each word takes O(K log K) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N \* K)
  - The space complexity is due to the storage of the dictionary and the grouped anagrams.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
     def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
          anna = {}
          for word in strs:
                sWord = ''.join(sorted(word))
                if sWord in anna:
                     anna[sWord].append(word)
                else:
                     anna[sWord] = [word]
          return list(anna.values())
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
Output = [["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]

# Test case 2
parameters = [""]
Output = [[""]]

# Test case 3
parameters = ["a"]
Output = [["a"]]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Using Character Count

- Instead of sorting, use a tuple of character counts as the key.
- **Complexity**: O(N _ K) Time | O(N _ K) Space
- Pros: Avoids the overhead of sorting.
- Cons: Slightly more complex to implement.

### Alternative 2: Using DefaultDict

- Use `collections.defaultdict` to simplify the dictionary operations.
- This approach can make the code cleaner and more readable.

  ```python
  from collections import defaultdict
  class Solution:
      def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
          anna = defaultdict(list)
          for word in strs:
              sWord = ''.join(sorted(word))
              anna[sWord].append(word)
          return list(anna.values())
  ```

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the sorting of words is done correctly. Handle edge cases like empty strings and single-character strings.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: Using `defaultdict` from the `collections` module can simplify the code.
