# Solution to [2089. Find Target Indices After Sorting Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-target-indices-after-sorting-array/)

---

## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy  

---

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The main idea is to sort the array and then find the indices of the target value. Sorting the array ensures that the target indices are in ascending order.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Sort the input array `nums`.
2. **Step 2**: Initialize an empty list `ans` to store the target indices.
3. **Step 3**: Iterate through the sorted array and append the index to `ans` whenever the element equals the target value.

---

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
    - Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, and iterating through the array takes O(n) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
    - The space complexity is constant as we are using a fixed amount of extra space.

---

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
        def targetIndices(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
                ans = []
                nums.sort()
                for ind, num in enumerate(nums):
                        if num == target:
                                ans.append(ind)
                return ans
```

---

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
parameters = ([1,2,5,2,3], 2)
Output = [1, 2]

# Test case 2
parameters = ([1,2,5,2,3], 3)
Output = [3]

# Test case 3
parameters = ([1,2,5,2,3], 5)
Output = [4]

# Test case 4
parameters = ([1,2,5,2,3], 4)
Output = []
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Binary Search
- Sort the array and use binary search to find the first and last occurrence of the target.
- **Complexity**: O(n log n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Efficient for finding the range of target indices.
- Cons: More complex to implement compared to the main solution.

### Alternative 2: Counting Sort
- Use counting sort to count occurrences of each number and then determine the target indices.
- **Complexity**: O(n + k) Time | O(k) Space (where k is the range of numbers)
- Pros: Linear time complexity for sorting.
- Cons: Requires additional space for counting.

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure the array is sorted before finding the target indices. Handle cases where the target is not present in the array.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: Sorting algorithms and binary search techniques can be useful for similar problems.
