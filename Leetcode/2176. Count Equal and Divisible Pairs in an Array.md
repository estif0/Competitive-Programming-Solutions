# Solution to [2176. Count Equal and Divisible Pairs in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-equal-and-divisible-pairs-in-an-array/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode
**Difficulty**: Easy

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution involves iterating through all possible pairs in the array and checking if they meet the given conditions: the elements are equal and the product of their indices is divisible by `k`.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of valid pairs.
2. **Step 2**: Use a nested loop to iterate through all possible pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j`.
3. **Step 3**: For each pair, check if `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `(i * j) % k == 0`. If both conditions are met, increment the counter.
4. **Step 4**: Return the counter as the result.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2)
  - The solution involves a nested loop iterating through all pairs of elements in the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution uses a constant amount of extra space.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def countPairs(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
                n = len(nums)
                count = 0
                for i in range(n-1):
                        for j in range(i+1, n):
                                if nums[i] == nums[j] and (i * j) % k == 0:
                                        count += 1
                return count
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = ([3,1,2,2,2,1,3], 2)
Output = 4

# Test case 2
parameters = ([1,2,3,4], 1)
Output = 0
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Using a HashMap

- Instead of using a nested loop, use a hashmap to store the indices of each element and then check the conditions.
- **Complexity**: O(n^2) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: May reduce the number of comparisons in some cases.
- Cons: Additional space required for the hashmap.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the indices `i` and `j` are correctly handled to avoid out-of-bound errors.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: Consider edge cases where the array has fewer than 2 elements.
