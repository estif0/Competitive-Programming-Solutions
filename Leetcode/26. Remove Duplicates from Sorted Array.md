# Solution to [26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

---

## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy  

---

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The main idea is to use two pointers to traverse the sorted array and remove duplicates in place. One pointer (`first`) tracks the position of the last unique element, while the other pointer (`second`) scans through the array to find the next unique element.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Initialization**: Start with two pointers, `first` at index 0 and `second` at index 1.
2. **Traversal**: Iterate through the array with the `second` pointer.
    - If the elements at `first` and `second` are the same, remove the element at `second`.
    - If they are different, move both pointers forward.
3. **Completion**: Continue this process until the `second` pointer reaches the end of the array.

---

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The algorithm traverses the array once with the `second` pointer, making it linear in time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution modifies the array in place and uses a constant amount of extra space.

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
     def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
          first, second = 0, 1
          if len(nums) > 1:
                while second < len(nums):
                     if nums[first] == nums[second]:
                          nums.pop(second)
                          continue
                     second += 1
                     first += 1
```

---

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [1, 1, 2]
Output = 2  # Array becomes [1, 2]

# Test case 2
parameters = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output = 5  # Array becomes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Using Set
- Use a set to track unique elements and rebuild the array.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Simpler implementation.
- Cons: Requires additional space.

### Alternative 2: Two Pointers with In-Place Modification
- Use two pointers to overwrite duplicates in place without popping elements.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: More efficient in terms of space.
- Cons: Slightly more complex implementation.

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure the array is sorted before applying this algorithm.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The `pop` method can be costly; consider alternatives for large arrays.
