# Solution to [189. Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Medium

---

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution involves reversing parts of the array to achieve the desired rotation. The main idea is to reverse the entire array first, then reverse the first `k` elements, and finally reverse the remaining elements.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Reverse the entire array.
2. **Step 2**: Reverse the first `k` elements.
3. **Step 3**: Reverse the remaining elements from `k` to the end of the array.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - Reversing the array and its parts involves linear time operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution uses constant extra space.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
                n = len(nums)
                k = k % n
                nums.reverse()
                l, r = 0, k - 1
                while l < r:
                        nums[l], nums[r] = nums[r], nums[l]
                        l += 1
                        r -= 1
                l, r = k, n - 1
                while l < r:
                        nums[l], nums[r] = nums[r], nums[l]
                        l += 1
                        r -= 1
                return nums
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 3)
Output = [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# Test case 2
parameters = ([-1, -100, 3, 99], 2)
Output = [3, 99, -1, -100]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Using Extra Array

- Copy elements to a new array in the rotated order and then copy them back to the original array.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Simple to implement.
- Cons: Requires extra space.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure `k` is within the bounds by using `k = k % n`.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: Reversing parts of the array is a common technique for in-place array manipulation.
