# Solution to [Range Sum Query - Immutable](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-immutable/)

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode
**Difficulty**: Easy

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea behind the solution is to use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of elements in a given range. By precomputing the cumulative sums, we can answer range sum queries in constant time.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Initialize the prefix sum array.
    - Use the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module to create a prefix sum array from the input list of numbers.
2. **Step 2**: Implement the `sumRange` method.
    - If the left index is 0, return the prefix sum at the right index.
    - Otherwise, return the difference between the prefix sum at the right index and the prefix sum at the left index minus one.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - The `sumRange` method performs constant time operations due to the precomputed prefix sum array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The space complexity is linear in terms of the input size due to the storage of the prefix sum array.

## Code Implementation

```python
from itertools import accumulate
from typing import List

class NumArray:

     def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
          self.nums = nums
          self.prefixSum = list(accumulate(self.nums))

     def sumRange(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
          if left == 0:
                return self.prefixSum[right]
          else:
                return self.prefixSum[right] - self.prefixSum[left - 1]

# Your NumArray object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = NumArray(nums)
# param_1 = obj.sumRange(left, right)
```

---

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
obj = NumArray(nums)
assert obj.sumRange(0, 2) == 6  # 1 + 2 + 3

# Test case 2
nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]
obj = NumArray(nums)
assert obj.sumRange(2, 5) == -1  # 3 + (-5) + 2 + (-1)
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Brute Force

- Calculate the sum for each query by iterating through the range.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Simple to implement.
- Cons: Inefficient for large input sizes due to linear time complexity for each query.

### Alternative 2: Segment Tree

- Use a segment tree to store range sums.
- **Complexity**: O(log n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Efficient for both updates and queries.
- Cons: More complex to implement compared to the prefix sum approach.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure the prefix sum array is correctly initialized to avoid off-by-one errors.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The `accumulate` function from `itertools` is useful for creating prefix sums.
