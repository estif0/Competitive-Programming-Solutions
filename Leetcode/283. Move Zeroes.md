# Solution to [283. Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

---

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea is to use two pointers to move all non-zero elements to the front of the array while maintaining their relative order, and then fill the remaining positions with zeroes.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, both set to the start of the array.
2. **Step 2**: Iterate through the array with the `right` pointer. If the element at `right` is non-zero and the element at `left` is zero, swap them.
3. **Step 3**: Increment the `left` pointer if it points to a non-zero element. Always increment the `right` pointer until the end of the array is reached.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The algorithm makes a single pass through the array, resulting in linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution uses a constant amount of extra space.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
                """
                Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
                """
                n = len(nums)
                left, right = 0, 0
                while right < n:
                        if nums[right] != 0 and nums[left] == 0:
                                nums[right], nums[left] = nums[left], nums[right]
                        if nums[left] != 0:
                                left += 1
                        right += 1
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
Output = [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]

# Test case 2
parameters = [0, 0, 1]
Output = [1, 0, 0]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Two-Pass Approach

- First, move all non-zero elements to the front of the array.
- Then, fill the remaining positions with zeroes.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Simpler to implement.
- Cons: Requires two passes through the array.

### Alternative 2: Using a Queue

- Use a queue to store the indices of zero elements and swap them with non-zero elements as they are encountered.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the relative order of non-zero elements is maintained.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The two-pointer technique is useful for similar problems involving rearrangement of elements.
