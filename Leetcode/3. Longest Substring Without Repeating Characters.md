## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea is to use a sliding window approach to keep track of the longest substring without repeating characters. We use a dictionary to store the frequency of characters within the current window and adjust the window size dynamically to ensure all characters are unique.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Initialize a dictionary `freq` to store character frequencies, `start` pointer to mark the beginning of the window, and `max_length` to store the maximum length of the substring found.
2. **Step 2**: Iterate through the string with an `end` pointer. For each character, update its frequency in the dictionary.
3. **Step 3**: If a character's frequency exceeds 1, it means there's a repetition. Adjust the `start` pointer to shrink the window until all characters are unique again.
4. **Step 4**: Update `max_length` with the maximum length of the current window.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We traverse the string once with the `end` pointer and adjust the `start` pointer as needed, resulting in a linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(min(n, m))
  - We use a dictionary to store the frequency of characters, where `n` is the length of the string and `m` is the size of the character set.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
                freq = {}
                start = 0
                max_length = 0

                for end in range(len(s)):
                        right_char = s[end]

                        if right_char not in freq:
                                freq[right_char] = 0
                        freq[right_char] += 1

                        while freq[right_char] > 1:
                                left_char = s[start]
                                freq[left_char] -= 1
                                if freq[left_char] == 0:
                                        del freq[left_char]
                                start += 1
                        max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)

                return max_length
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = "abcabcbb"
Output = 3  # Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

# Test case 2
parameters = "bbbbb"
Output = 1  # Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

# Test case 3
parameters = "pwwkew"
Output = 3  # Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Using Set

- Instead of a dictionary, use a set to track characters in the current window.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(min(n, m)) Space
- Pros: Simpler implementation.
- Cons: Slightly less efficient due to set operations.

  ```python
  class Solution:
          def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
                  start = 0
                  max_length = 0
                  chars = set()

                  for end in range(len(s)):
                          right_char = s[end]

                          while right_char in chars:
                                  left_char = s[start]
                                  chars.remove(left_char)
                                  start += 1
                          chars.add(right_char)
                          max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)

                  return max_length
  ```
