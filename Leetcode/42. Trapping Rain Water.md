# Solution to [Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

---

## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Hard  

---

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The solution uses dynamic programming to precompute the maximum heights to the left and right of each bar. By comparing these precomputed values, we can determine the amount of water that can be trapped at each position.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Initialize two arrays `ml` and `mr` to store the maximum heights to the left and right of each bar, respectively.
2. **Step 2**: Populate the `ml` array by iterating from left to right. For each position, store the maximum height encountered so far to the left.
3. **Step 3**: Populate the `mr` array by iterating from right to left. For each position, store the maximum height encountered so far to the right.
4. **Step 4**: Iterate through each bar and calculate the water trapped at that position by taking the minimum of the maximum heights to the left and right, and subtracting the height of the current bar. Accumulate this value to get the total trapped water.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
    - The solution involves three linear scans of the input array, making the time complexity linear.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
    - Two additional arrays of size `n` are used to store the maximum heights to the left and right.

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
        def trap(self, h: List[int]) -> int:
                if not h:
                        return 0

                n = len(h)
                ml = [0] * n
                mr = [0] * n
                ans = 0

                for i in range(1, n):
                        ml[i] = max(ml[i-1], h[i-1])
                
                for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
                        mr[i] = max(mr[i+1], h[i+1])

                for i in range(n):
                        comp = min(ml[i], mr[i])
                        w = comp - h[i]
                        if w > 0:
                                ans += w

                return ans
```

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output = 6

# Test case 2
parameters = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output = 9
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Two-pointer Technique
- Instead of using extra space for arrays, use two pointers to traverse the height array from both ends.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Reduced space complexity.
- Cons: Slightly more complex to implement.
    ```python
    class Solution:
            def trap(self, h: List[int]) -> int:
                    if not h:
                            return 0

                    n = len(h)
                    ml, mr = 0, 0
                    left, right = 0, n-1
                    ans = 0

                    while left < right:
                            if h[left] < h[right]:
                                    if h[left] >= ml:
                                            ml = h[left]
                                    else:
                                            ans += ml - h[left]
                                    left += 1
                            else:
                                    if h[right] >= mr:
                                            mr = h[right]
                                    else:
                                            ans += mr - h[right]
                                    right -= 1

                    return ans
    ```

### Alternative 2: Stack-based Approach
- Use a stack to keep track of the bars that are bounded by taller bars.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Intuitive for some to visualize the trapping process.
- Cons: Requires additional space for the stack.
    ```python
    class Solution:
            def trap(self, h: List[int]) -> int:
                    if not h:
                            return 0

                    n = len(h)
                    stack = []
                    ans = 0

                    for i in range(n):
                            while stack and h[i] > h[stack[-1]]:
                                    top = stack.pop()
                                    if not stack:
                                            break
                                    dist = i - stack[-1] - 1
                                    bounded_height = min(h[i], h[stack[-1]]) - h[top]
                                    ans += dist * bounded_height

                            stack.append(i)

                    return ans
    ```

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure to handle edge cases where the input array is empty or has less than three bars.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The two-pointer technique can be useful for similar problems involving bounded regions.
