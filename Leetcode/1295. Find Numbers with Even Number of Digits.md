# Solution to [1295. Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-numbers-with-even-number-of-digits/)

---

## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy  

---

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The main idea is to iterate through the list of numbers, convert each number to a string to count its digits, and check if the number of digits is even. If it is, we increment our count.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Initialize a counter `ans` to zero. This will keep track of the numbers with an even number of digits.
2. **Step 2**: Iterate through each number in the input list `nums`.
    - Convert the number to a string to determine its length.
    - Check if the length of the string (number of digits) is even.
3. **Step 3**: If the number of digits is even, increment the counter `ans`.
4. **Step 4**: Return the counter `ans` as the result.

> **Example**: For the input list `[12, 345, 2, 6, 7896]`, the numbers `12` and `7896` have an even number of digits. Thus, the output would be `2`.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We iterate through the list of numbers once, and converting a number to a string and checking its length are O(1) operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We use a constant amount of extra space for the counter `ans`.

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
     def findNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
          ans = 0
          for num in nums:
                n = len(str(num))
                if n % 2 == 0:
                     ans += 1
          return ans
```

---

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [12, 345, 2, 6, 7896]
Output = 2

# Test case 2
parameters = [555, 901, 482, 1771]
Output = 1
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Using List Comprehension
- Instead of a loop, use a list comprehension to filter numbers with an even number of digits and return the length of the resulting list.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: More concise code.
- Cons: Uses additional space for the list.

### Alternative 2: Using Mathematical Operations
- Instead of converting to a string, use logarithmic operations to determine the number of digits.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Avoids string conversion.
- Cons: Slightly more complex to implement.

    ```python
    class Solution:
         def findNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
              ans = 0
              for num in nums:
                    if (int(log10(num)) + 1) % 2 == 0:
                         ans += 1
              return ans
    ```

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure to handle edge cases such as empty input list or very large numbers.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The `len(str(num))` method is a quick way to count digits. You can also use `log10` for a mathematical approach.
