# Solution to [1480. Running Sum of 1d Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea behind the solution is to iterate through the array and update each element to be the sum of itself and all previous elements. This approach ensures that each element at index `i` contains the running sum of elements from index `0` to `i`.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Initialize a loop starting from the second element (index 1) of the array.
2. **Step 2**: For each element at index `i`, update it to be the sum of itself and the element at index `i-1`.
3. **Step 3**: Continue this process until the end of the array is reached. The array will then contain the running sum of elements.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The solution involves a single pass through the array, making the time complexity linear with respect to the number of elements.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution modifies the input array in place and does not require additional space proportional to the input size.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
                for i in range(1, len(nums)):
                        nums[i] += nums[i - 1]
                return nums
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output = [1, 3, 6, 10]

# Test case 2
parameters = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Output = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Test case 3
parameters = [3, 1, 2, 10, 1]
Output = [3, 4, 6, 16, 17]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Using a New Array

- Instead of modifying the input array, create a new array to store the running sums.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Does not modify the input array.
- Cons: Requires additional space for the new array.

  ```python
  class Solution:
      def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
          result = [nums[0]]
          for i in range(1, len(nums)):
              result.append(result[-1] + nums[i])
          return result
  ```

### Alternative 2: Using itertools.accumulate

- Use the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module to compute the running sum.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Concise and leverages built-in functions.
- Cons: Requires importing an additional module.

  ```python
  from itertools import accumulate
  class Solution:
      def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
          return list(accumulate(nums))
  ```

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the input array is not empty before attempting to access elements.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The `accumulate` function from `itertools` can be useful for similar problems involving cumulative sums.
