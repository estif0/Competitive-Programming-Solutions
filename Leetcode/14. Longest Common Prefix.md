# Solution to [Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)

---

## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy  

---

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The solution involves finding the smallest string in the list and using it as a reference to compare characters at each position with other strings. If a mismatch is found, the common prefix up to that point is returned.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Identify the smallest string in the list, as the longest common prefix cannot be longer than this string.
2. **Step 2**: Initialize an empty string `ans` to store the common prefix and an index `idx` to track the current character position.
3. **Step 3**: Iterate through each character of the smallest string and compare it with the corresponding character in all other strings.
4. **Step 4**: If a mismatch is found, return the current value of `ans`.
5. **Step 5**: If no mismatch is found, append the character to `ans` and move to the next character.
6. **Step 6**: Return the final value of `ans` after all characters are checked.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * M)
    - N is the number of strings, and M is the length of the smallest string. Each character of the smallest string is compared with all other strings.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
    - Only a few extra variables are used, regardless of the input size.

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
        def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
                ans = ''
                fi = min(strs)
                idx = 0
                for _ in range(len(fi)):
                        for itn in range(len(strs)):
                                if fi[idx] != strs[itn][idx]:       
                                        return ans
                        ans += fi[idx]
                        idx += 1
                return ans
```

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
parameters = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
Output = "fl"

# Test case 2
parameters = ["dog", "racecar", "car"]
Output = ""

# Test case 3
parameters = ["interspecies", "interstellar", "interstate"]
Output = "inters"

# Test case 4
parameters = ["throne", "throne"]
Output = "throne"

# Test case 5
parameters = ["throne", "dungeon"]
Output = ""
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Horizontal Scanning
- Compare each string with the current prefix and update the prefix accordingly.
- **Complexity**: O(N * M) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Simple to implement.
- Cons: May be slower for large inputs.

### Alternative 2: Vertical Scanning
- Compare characters of each string column by column.
- **Complexity**: O(N * M) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Efficient for small strings.
- Cons: May be less intuitive.

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure to handle edge cases where the list is empty or contains only one string.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The `min` function can be used to find the smallest string in terms of lexicographical order.
