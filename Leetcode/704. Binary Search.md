# Solution to [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

---

## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy  

---

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The problem requires finding the index of a target value within a sorted array using the binary search technique. The main idea is to iteratively narrow down the search space by comparing the middle element with the target.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Initialize Pointers**: Set `low` to 0 and `high` to the length of the array minus one.
2. **Binary Search Loop**: 
   - Calculate `mid` as the average of `low` and `high`.
   - If `arr[mid]` equals the target, return `mid`.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than the target, update `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - Otherwise, update `low` to `mid + 1`.
3. **Return -1**: If the loop exits without finding the target, return -1.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
  - The time complexity is logarithmic because the search space is halved each iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The space complexity is constant because no additional space is used.

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, arr: List[int], key: int) -> int:
        low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (high + low) // 2
            if arr[mid] == key:
                return mid
            if arr[mid] > key:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        return -1
```

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
key = 3
Output = 2

# Test case 2
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
key = 6
Output = -1

# Test case 3
arr = [-10, -5, 0, 5, 10]
key = -5
Output = 1
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Recursive Binary Search
- A recursive approach can be used where the function calls itself with updated `low` and `high` values.
- **Complexity**: O(log n) Time | O(log n) Space
- This approach uses additional space on the call stack for recursion.

### Alternative 2: Linear Search
- Iterate through the array from start to end to find the target.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- This approach is less efficient for large arrays compared to binary search.

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that integer division is used correctly to calculate the `mid` index.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: Binary search is a common technique for problems involving sorted arrays.
