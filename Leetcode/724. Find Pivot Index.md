# Solution to [724. Find Pivot Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-pivot-index/)

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea is to find an index where the sum of the numbers to the left is equal to the sum of the numbers to the right. We can achieve this by maintaining a running sum of the left side and calculating the right side sum by subtracting the current element and the left sum from the total sum.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Initialize two variables, `ls` (left sum) to 0 and `rs` (right sum) to the total sum of the array.
2. **Step 2**: Iterate through the array. For each element, subtract it from `rs` to get the right sum excluding the current element.
3. **Step 3**: Check if `ls` is equal to `rs`. If they are equal, return the current index as the pivot index.
4. **Step 4**: If not, add the current element to `ls` and continue to the next element.
5. **Step 5**: If no pivot index is found, return -1.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We iterate through the array once, making the time complexity linear.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We use a constant amount of extra space for the variables `ls` and `rs`.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def pivotIndex(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                ls, rs = 0, sum(nums)
                for ind, num in enumerate(nums):
                        rs -= num
                        if ls == rs:
                                return ind
                        ls += num
                return -1
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [1, 7, 3, 6, 5, 6]
Output = 3

# Test case 2
parameters = [1, 2, 3]
Output = -1

# Test case 3
parameters = [2, 1, -1]
Output = 0
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Prefix Sum Array

- Use a prefix sum array to store the cumulative sum up to each index and then find the pivot index by comparing the prefix sums.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Easier to understand.
- Cons: Uses extra space for the prefix sum array.

```python
class Solution:
        def pivotIndex(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                prefix_sum = [0] + list(accumulate(nums))
                total_sum = prefix_sum[-1]
                for ind, num in enumerate(nums):
                        if prefix_sum[ind] == total_sum - prefix_sum[ind + 1]:
                                return ind
                return -1
```

### Alternative 2: Two-Pass Approach

- First pass to calculate the total sum, second pass to find the pivot index by maintaining the left sum.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Forgetting to update the left sum after checking the condition.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The problem can be extended to find multiple pivot indices if they exist.
