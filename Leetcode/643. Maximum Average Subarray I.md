## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum average of any subarray of length `k`. By maintaining a running sum of the current window and updating it as the window slides, we can efficiently compute the maximum average.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Initialize Variables**: Start by initializing `ans` to negative infinity to store the maximum average found. Initialize `_sum` to 0 to store the sum of the current window, and `start` to 0 to mark the beginning of the window.
2. **Iterate Through the Array**: Use a for loop to iterate through the array with `end` as the index.
3. **Update the Window Sum**: Add the current element `nums[end]` to `_sum`.
4. **Check Window Size**: Once the window size reaches `k`, calculate the average and update `ans` if the current average is greater. Then, subtract the element at the `start` index from `_sum` and increment `start` to slide the window.
5. **Return the Result**: After the loop, return `ans` which contains the maximum average.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The algorithm iterates through the array once, making it linear in time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The space complexity is constant as no additional space proportional to the input size is used.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def findMaxAverage(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> float:
                ans = float('-inf')
                _sum, start = 0, 0
                for end in range(len(nums)):
                        _sum += nums[end]
                        if end >= k - 1:
                                if _sum / k > ans:
                                        ans = _sum / k
                                _sum -= nums[start]
                                start += 1
                return ans
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = ([1,12,-5,-6,50,3], 4)
Output = 12.75

# Test case 2
parameters = ([5,5,5,5,5], 1)
Output = 5.0
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Brute Force

- Calculate the sum of every subarray of length `k` and find the maximum average.
- **Complexity**: O(n\*k) Time | O(1) Space
- This approach is less efficient compared to the sliding window method.

### Alternative 2: Prefix Sum Array

- Use a prefix sum array to calculate the sum of subarrays more efficiently.
- This approach can be more complex to implement but can offer similar time complexity.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the window size `k` is valid and does not exceed the length of the array.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: Sliding window techniques are useful for problems involving subarrays or substrings.
