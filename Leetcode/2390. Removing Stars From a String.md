# Solution to [2390. Removing Stars From a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/removing-stars-from-a-string/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea behind the solution is to use a stack to process the characters in the string. For each character, if it is a star (`*`), we pop the top character from the stack (if the stack is not empty). If it is not a star, we push the character onto the stack. Finally, we join the characters in the stack to form the resulting string.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Initialize an empty stack to keep track of the characters.
2. **Step 2**: Iterate through each character in the input string:
   - If the character is a star (`*`), pop the top character from the stack (if the stack is not empty).
   - If the character is not a star, push it onto the stack.
3. **Step 3**: After processing all characters, join the characters in the stack to form the final string and return it.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The solution iterates through each character in the string once, performing constant-time operations for each character.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The space used by the stack is proportional to the number of characters in the input string.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
     def removeStars(self, s: str) -> str:
          stack = []

          for char in s:
                if char == "*":
                     if stack:
                          stack.pop()
                else:
                     stack.append(char)
          return ''.join(stack)
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = "leet**cod*e"
Output = "lecoe"

# Test case 2
parameters = "erase*****"
Output = ""
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Two-Pointer Approach

- Instead of using a stack, we can use two pointers to process the string in place.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Uses constant space.
- Cons: More complex to implement compared to the stack-based approach.

  ```python
  class Solution:
       def removeStars(self, s: str) -> str:
            i, j = 0, 0
            while j < len(s):
                  if s[j] == "*":
                       if i > 0:
                            i -= 1
                  else:
                       s[i] = s[j]
                       i += 1
                  j += 1
            return s[:i]
  ```

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the stack is not empty before attempting to pop a character.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The stack-based approach is a common technique for problems involving backspace or undo operations.
