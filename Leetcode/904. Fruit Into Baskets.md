## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The problem requires finding the longest subarray containing at most two distinct integers. This can be solved using the sliding window technique, where we maintain a window that contains at most two distinct integers and adjust its size dynamically.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Initialize variables `max_len` to store the maximum length of the subarray, `start` to mark the beginning of the window, and `freq` as a dictionary to count the frequency of each fruit in the current window.
2. **Step 2**: Iterate through the list of fruits using the `end` pointer. For each fruit, update its count in the `freq` dictionary.
3. **Step 3**: If the number of distinct fruits in the window exceeds two, shrink the window from the left by incrementing the `start` pointer until the window contains at most two distinct fruits.
4. **Step 4**: Update `max_len` with the maximum length of the window observed so far.
5. **Step 5**: Return `max_len` as the result.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The algorithm processes each element of the array at most twice (once when expanding the window and once when contracting it), resulting in linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The space complexity is constant as the `freq` dictionary will store at most three keys (two distinct fruits and one extra during the transition).

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def totalFruit(self, fruits: List[int]) -> int:
                max_len = 0
                start = 0
                freq = {}
                for end in range(len(fruits)):
                        curr = fruits[end]
                        freq[curr] = freq.get(curr, 0) + 1

                        while len(freq) > 2:
                                left = fruits[start]
                                freq[left] -= 1
                                if freq[left] == 0:
                                        del freq[left]
                                start += 1
                        max_len = max(max_len, end - start + 1)
                return max_len
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
fruits = [1, 2, 1]
Output = 3

# Test case 2
fruits = [0, 1, 2, 2]
Output = 3

# Test case 3
fruits = [1, 2, 3, 2, 2]
Output = 4

# Test case 4
fruits = [3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]
Output = 5
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Two Pointers with HashMap

- This approach is similar to the sliding window but uses two pointers explicitly to manage the window.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Simple to implement and understand.
- Cons: Similar performance to the main solution.

### Alternative 2: Brute Force

- Iterate through all possible subarrays and check if they contain at most two distinct integers.
- **Complexity**: O(n^2) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Easy to understand.
- Cons: Inefficient for large inputs.

  ```python
  def totalFruit(self, fruits: List[int]) -> int:
      max_len = 0
      for i in range(len(fruits)):
          freq = {}
          for j in range(i, len(fruits)):
              freq[fruits[j]] = freq.get(fruits[j], 0) + 1
              if len(freq) > 2:
                  break
              max_len = max(max_len, j - i + 1)
      return max_len
  ```
