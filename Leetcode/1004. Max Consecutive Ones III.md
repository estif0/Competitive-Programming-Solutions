## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea is to use a sliding window approach to find the longest subarray with at most `k` zeros. We maintain a window with a maximum number of ones and adjust the window size based on the number of zeros encountered.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Initialize Variables**: Start with `start`, `max_len`, and `max_rep` set to 0. Use a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of elements in the current window.
2. **Expand the Window**: Iterate through the array with an `end` pointer. For each element, update its frequency in the `freq` dictionary and update `max_rep` to the maximum frequency of ones.
3. **Adjust the Window**: If the current window size minus `max_rep` exceeds `k`, shrink the window from the left by incrementing the `start` pointer and updating the frequency of the element at the `start` position.
4. **Update Maximum Length**: Continuously update `max_len` to the maximum size of the valid window encountered.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The algorithm processes each element of the array at most twice (once when expanding the window and once when shrinking it).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The space used by the `freq` dictionary is limited to the number of unique elements, which is constant (0 and 1).

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
                start, max_len, max_rep = 0, 0, 0
                freq = {}
                for end, num in enumerate(nums):
                        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
                        max_rep = max(max_rep, freq.get(1, 0))

                        if (end - start + 1 - max_rep) > k:
                                left = nums[start]
                                freq[left] -= 1
                                if freq[left] == 0:
                                        del freq[left]
                                start += 1
                        max_len = max(end - start + 1, max_len)
                return max_len
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = ([1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], 2)
Output = 6

# Test case 2
parameters = ([0,0,1,1,1,0,0], 0)
Output = 3

# Test case 3
parameters = ([0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], 2)
Output = 8
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Binary Search

- Use binary search to find the maximum length of the subarray that can be formed with at most `k` zeros.
- **Complexity**: O(n log n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Useful for understanding the problem from a different perspective.
- Cons: Higher time complexity compared to the sliding window approach.

```python
class Solution:
        def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
                def check(length):
                        start = 0
                        zeros = 0
                        for end in range(len(nums)):
                                if nums[end] == 0:
                                        zeros += 1
                                if zeros > k:
                                        if nums[start] == 0:
                                                zeros -= 1
                                        start += 1
                        return end - start + 1

                left, right = 0, len(nums)
                while left < right:
                        mid = (left + right) // 2
                        if check(mid) >= mid:
                                left = mid + 1
                        else:
                                right = mid
                return left - 1
```
