# Solution to [Height Checker](https://leetcode.com/problems/height-checker/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

---

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea is to compare the given list of heights with a sorted version of the same list. By counting the number of positions where the elements differ, we can determine how many students are not in the correct positions.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Sort the list of heights to get the expected order.
2. **Step 2**: Initialize a counter to zero.
3. **Step 3**: Iterate through the original list and the sorted list simultaneously, comparing elements at each position.
4. **Step 4**: Increment the counter for each mismatch found.
5. **Step 5**: Return the counter as the result.

> **Example**: If using a two-pointer technique, mention how the pointers interact with the data and when they are incremented or decremented.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
  - Sorting the list takes O(n log n) time, and comparing the lists takes O(n) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - Additional space is used for the sorted list.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def heightChecker(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
                expected = sorted(heights)
                n = len(heights)
                ans = 0
                for i in range(n):
                        if heights[i] != expected[i]:
                                ans += 1
                return ans
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3]
Output = 3

# Test case 2
parameters = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output = 5

# Test case 3
parameters = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output = 0
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Counting Sort

- Use a counting sort approach to determine the expected order.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: More efficient for this specific problem.
- Cons: Less intuitive and harder to implement.
