# Solution to [88. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

---

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution involves merging two sorted arrays into one sorted array in-place. The main idea is to append elements from the second array to the first and then sort the combined array.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Iterate through each element in `nums2`.
2. **Step 2**: Append each element from `nums2` to the end of `nums1` starting from index `m`.
3. **Step 3**: Sort the combined array `nums1` to ensure all elements are in non-decreasing order.

---

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O((m+n) log(m+n))
  - Sorting the combined array `nums1` takes O((m+n) log(m+n)) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution modifies `nums1` in-place and does not use any additional space.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
                """
                Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
                """
                if n >= 1:
                        for i in nums2:
                                nums1[m] = i
                                m += 1
                        nums1.sort()
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0]
m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6]
n = 3
Solution().merge(nums1, m, nums2, n)
# Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]

# Test case 2
nums1 = [1]
m = 1
nums2 = []
n = 0
Solution().merge(nums1, m, nums2, n)
# Output: [1]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Two Pointers Approach

- Use two pointers to compare elements from the end of both arrays and place the larger element at the end of `nums1`.
- **Complexity**: O(m+n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: More efficient in terms of time complexity.
- Cons: Slightly more complex to implement.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that `nums1` has enough space to accommodate all elements from `nums2`.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: Sorting in-place can be done using `nums1.sort()`.
