## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution involves using a stack to process the directory names in the given path. By iterating through each part of the path, we can handle the navigation commands (`..`, `.`, and empty strings) appropriately to construct the simplified absolute path.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Split the input path by the '/' delimiter to get individual directory names.
2. **Step 2**: Initialize an empty stack to keep track of the valid directory names.
3. **Step 3**: Iterate through each directory name:
   - If the directory name is empty or a single dot (`.`), skip it.
   - If the directory name is a double dot (`..`), pop the top element from the stack if the stack is not empty.
   - Otherwise, push the directory name onto the stack.
4. **Step 4**: Join the elements in the stack with '/' to form the simplified absolute path and return it.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The solution involves a single pass through the input path, where `n` is the length of the path.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The space used by the stack can be up to the length of the path in the worst case.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
     def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
          stack = []
          for dir in path.split('/'):
                if dir == '' or dir == '.':
                     continue
                if dir == '..':
                     if stack:
                          stack.pop()
                else:
                     stack.append(dir)
          absolute_path = '/' + '/'.join(stack)
          return absolute_path
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = "/home/"
Output = "/home"

# Test case 2
parameters = "/../"
Output = "/"

# Test case 3
parameters = "/home//foo/"
Output = "/home/foo"

# Test case 4
parameters = "/a/./b/../../c/"
Output = "/c"
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Using Deque

- A deque could be used instead of a list for the stack operations to potentially improve performance.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Deque provides efficient append and pop operations from both ends.
- Cons: Slightly more complex to implement compared to a list.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure to handle multiple consecutive slashes and edge cases like paths ending with a slash.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The `split` method is useful for breaking down the path into components.
