# Solution to [191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

---

## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy  

---

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The main idea is to convert the given integer to its binary representation and count the number of '1' bits in it.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Convert the integer `n` to its binary representation using Python's `bin()` function.
2. **Step 2**: Use the `count()` method to count the number of '1' bits in the binary string.
3. **Step 3**: Return the count as the result.

> **Example**: For `n = 11`, the binary representation is `0b1011`, which has three '1' bits.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
    - The time complexity is O(log n) because converting a number to its binary representation takes O(log n) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
    - The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of space.

---

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
        def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
                bitr = bin(n)
                return bitr.count('1')
```

---

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
parameters = 11
Output = 3

# Test case 2
parameters = 128
Output = 1

# Test case 3
parameters = 4294967293
Output = 31
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Bit Manipulation
- Use bit manipulation to count the number of '1' bits by shifting and masking.
- **Complexity**: O(log n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: More efficient in terms of operations.
- Cons: More complex to implement and understand.

### Alternative 2: Brian Kernighan's Algorithm
- Use Brian Kernighan's algorithm to count the number of '1' bits by repeatedly flipping the least significant '1' bit.
- **Complexity**: O(k) Time | O(1) Space, where k is the number of '1' bits.
- Pros: Efficient for sparse bit representations.
- Cons: Slightly more complex than the basic approach.

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the input is a non-negative integer.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The `bin()` function in Python is useful for binary conversions.
