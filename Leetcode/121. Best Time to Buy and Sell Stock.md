## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea is to use a two-pointer technique to find the maximum profit by iterating through the list of prices. We maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`, where `left` points to the minimum price seen so far and `right` iterates through the list to find the maximum profit.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Initialization**: Start with two pointers, `left` at the beginning and `right` at the second position. Initialize `profit` to 0.
2. **Iterate through prices**: Move the `right` pointer through the list.
   - If the price at `left` is less than the price at `right`, calculate the current profit and update the maximum profit if the current profit is higher.
   - If the price at `left` is greater than or equal to the price at `right`, move the `left` pointer to the `right` position.
3. **Return the maximum profit**: After iterating through the list, return the maximum profit found.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We iterate through the list of prices once with the `right` pointer, making the time complexity linear.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We use a constant amount of extra space for the pointers and the profit variable.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
     def maxProfit(self, prices):
          n = len(prices)
          left, right = 0, 1
          profit = 0

          while right < n:
                curr = prices[right] - prices[left]
                if prices[left] < prices[right]:
                     profit = max(curr, profit)
                else:
                     left = right
                right += 1

          return profit
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output = 5

# Test case 2
parameters = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output = 0
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Brute Force

- Check all possible pairs of buy and sell days to find the maximum profit.
- **Complexity**: O(n^2) Time | O(1) Space
- This approach is less efficient due to its quadratic time complexity.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the `left` pointer is always less than the `right` pointer to avoid negative profits.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The two-pointer technique is useful for problems involving subarrays or pairs.
