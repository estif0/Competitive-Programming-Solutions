# Solution to [350. Intersection of Two Arrays II](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/)

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution involves using a hash map to count the occurrences of each element in the first array. Then, we iterate through the second array and check if the element exists in the hash map with a count greater than zero. If it does, we add it to the result and decrement the count in the hash map.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Count the occurrences of each element in `nums1` using a `Counter` from the `collections` module.
2. **Step 2**: Initialize an empty list `ans` to store the intersection result.
3. **Step 3**: Iterate through each element in `nums2`. For each element, check if it exists in the `Counter` with a count greater than zero.
   - If it does, append the element to `ans` and decrement the count in the `Counter`.
4. **Step 4**: Return the list `ans` as the result.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m)
  - Counting elements in `nums1` takes O(n), and iterating through `nums2` takes O(m), where n and m are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage required for the `Counter` of `nums1`.

## Code Implementation

```python
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
     def intersect(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
          counts = Counter(nums1)
          ans = []
          for num in nums2:
                if counts[num] > 0:
                     ans.append(num)
                     counts[num] -= 1
          return ans
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = ([1, 2, 2, 1], [2, 2])
Output = [2, 2]

# Test case 2
parameters = ([4, 9, 5], [9, 4, 9, 8, 4])
Output = [4, 9]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Two Pointers Approach

- Sort both arrays and use two pointers to find the intersection.
- **Complexity**: O(n log n + m log m) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: No additional space required.
- Cons: Sorting the arrays increases the time complexity.

### Alternative 2: Binary Search

- Use binary search for each element in the smaller array on the sorted larger array.
- **Complexity**: O(n log m) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Efficient for large arrays.
- Cons: Requires sorted arrays.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure to decrement the count in the `Counter` to avoid duplicate entries in the result.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is useful for counting elements in an iterable.
