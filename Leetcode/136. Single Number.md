# Solution to [136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

---

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea is to use a set to keep track of unique numbers and a counter to count occurrences. The number that appears only once is the solution.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Initialize a set with unique numbers from the input list.
2. **Step 2**: Use a counter to count the occurrences of each number in the list.
3. **Step 3**: Iterate through the set and return the number that has a count of one.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The solution involves iterating through the list to create the set and counter, and then iterating through the set.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - Additional space is used for the set and counter.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                uniq = set(nums)
                count = Counter(nums)
                for num in uniq:
                        if count[num] == 1:
                                return num
```

---

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [2, 2, 1]
Output = 1

# Test case 2
parameters = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
Output = 4

# Test case 3
parameters = [1]
Output = 1
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Bit Manipulation

- Use XOR operation to find the single number.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: More space-efficient.
- Cons: Requires understanding of bitwise operations.

  ```python
  class Solution:
          def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                  res = 0
                  for num in nums:
                          res ^= num
                  return res
  ```

### Alternative 2: Sorting

- Sort the array and find the single number by checking adjacent elements.
- **Complexity**: O(n log n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Simple to implement.
- Cons: Less efficient due to sorting.

  ```python
  class Solution:
          def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                  nums.sort()
                  for i in range(0, len(nums), 2):
                          if i == len(nums) - 1 or nums[i] != nums[i + 1]:
                                  return nums[i]
  ```

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Forgetting to handle edge cases like an empty list or a list with only one element.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The XOR approach is a common trick for problems involving finding unique elements.
