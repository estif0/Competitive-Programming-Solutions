# Solution to [1929. Concatenation of Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenation-of-array/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode
**Difficulty**: Easy

---

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea is to concatenate the given array with itself. This can be achieved by simply multiplying the array by 2.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Identify the input array `nums`.
2. **Step 2**: Use the multiplication operation to concatenate the array with itself (`nums * 2`).
3. **Step 3**: Return the concatenated array as the result.

---

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
    - The time complexity is linear because we are iterating through the array once to create the concatenated result.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
    - The space complexity is linear as we are storing the concatenated array which is twice the size of the input array.

---

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def getConcatenation(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
                return nums * 2
```

---

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [1, 2, 1]
Output = [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]

# Test case 2
parameters = [1, 3, 2, 1]
Output = [1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Using a loop

- Instead of using the multiplication operation, we can use a loop to append elements of the array to itself.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- This approach is more verbose but achieves the same result.

### Alternative 2: Using list comprehension

- We can use list comprehension to create the concatenated array.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- This approach is also more verbose but can be useful in understanding list operations.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the input array is not modified in place if the original array is needed later.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: Multiplying a list by an integer in Python creates a new list with repeated elements.
