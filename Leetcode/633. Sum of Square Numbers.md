## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution uses a two-pointer approach to determine if a given number can be expressed as the sum of two square numbers. By iterating from both ends towards the center, we can efficiently check all possible pairs of squares.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Initialize two pointers, `left` starting at 0 and `right` starting at the integer square root of the given number `c`.
2. **Step 2**: Use a while loop to iterate as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`. Calculate the sum of the squares of the numbers pointed to by `left` and `right`.
3. **Step 3**: If the calculated sum is greater than `c`, decrement the `right` pointer. If the sum is less than `c`, increment the `left` pointer. If the sum equals `c`, return `True`.
4. **Step 4**: If the loop ends without finding a valid pair, return `False`.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(√c)
  - The time complexity is determined by the range of the two pointers, which is from 0 to the square root of `c`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The space complexity is constant as no additional data structures are used.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def judgeSquareSum(self, c: int) -> bool:
                left, right = 0, int(c ** 0.5)
                while left <= right:
                        guess = left * left + right * right
                        if guess > c:
                                right -= 1
                        elif guess < c:
                                left += 1
                        else:
                                return True
                return False
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = 5
Output = True  # 1^2 + 2^2 = 5

# Test case 2
parameters = 3
Output = False  # No pair of squares sum to 3

# Test case 3
parameters = 4
Output = True  # 0^2 + 2^2 = 4

# Test case 4
parameters = 2
Output = True  # 1^2 + 1^2 = 2

# Test case 5
parameters = 1
Output = True  # 0^2 + 1^2 = 1
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Using a Set

- Use a set to store squares of numbers up to the square root of `c` and check if `c - square` is also a square.
- **Complexity**: O(√c) Time | O(√c) Space
- Pros: Easier to understand and implement.
- Cons: Uses additional space.

### Alternative 2: Mathematical Approach

- Check if `c` can be expressed as the sum of two squares using number theory properties.
- **Complexity**: O(log c) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: More efficient in terms of space.
- Cons: More complex to implement.
