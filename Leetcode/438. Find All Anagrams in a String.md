# Solution to [Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution uses a sliding window approach to find all anagrams of the string `p` in the string `s`. By maintaining a count of characters in the current window and comparing it with the count of characters in `p`, we can efficiently find all starting indices of the anagrams.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1: Initialize Variables**  
   Calculate the lengths of `p` and `s`. Create counters for `p` and the initial window in `s`. Initialize an empty list to store the result and set the starting index of the window to 0.
2. **Step 2: Sliding Window**  
   Iterate through `s` starting from the end of the initial window to the end of `s`. For each position:
   - Compare the current window's character count with `p`'s character count. If they match, add the starting index to the result.
   - Update the window by decrementing the count of the character at the start of the window and incrementing the count of the new character at the end of the window.
   - Move the start of the window one step to the right.
3. **Step 3: Final Check**  
   After the loop, perform a final comparison for the last window.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The algorithm processes each character in `s` exactly once, making it linear in terms of the length of `s`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The space used by the counters is constant since the alphabet size is fixed.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
      def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
             plen, slen = len(p), len(s)
             p_count = Counter(p)
             s_count = Counter(s[:plen])
             result = []
             start = 0
             for end in range(plen, slen):
                     if p_count == s_count:
                            result.append(start)

                     s_count[s[start]] -= 1
                     if s_count[s[start]] == 0:
                            del s_count[s[start]]
                     start += 1

                     s_count[s[end]] += 1

             if p_count == s_count:
                     result.append(start)

             return result
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = ("cbaebabacd", "abc")
Output = [0, 6]

# Test case 2
parameters = ("abab", "ab")
Output = [0, 1, 2]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Brute Force

- Check all substrings of length `len(p)` in `s` and compare their sorted versions with `p`.
- **Complexity**: O(n \* m log m) Time | O(m) Space
- This approach is less efficient due to the sorting step for each substring.

### Alternative 2: Hash Map with Fixed Size

- Use a fixed-size hash map to store character counts and slide the window over `s`.
- This approach is similar to the main solution but can be implemented differently.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure the window is updated correctly by handling character counts accurately.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is useful for counting characters efficiently.
