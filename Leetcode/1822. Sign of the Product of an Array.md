# Solution to [Sign of the Product of an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/sign-of-the-product-of-an-array/)

---

## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The solution involves iterating through the array and determining the sign of the product by checking each element. If any element is zero, the product is zero. If the number of negative elements is odd, the product is negative; otherwise, it is positive.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Initialize a variable `ans` to 1, which will hold the sign of the product.
2. **Step 2**: Iterate through each element in the array:
    - If the element is positive, multiply `ans` by 1 (no change).
    - If the element is zero, return 0 immediately as the product will be zero.
    - If the element is negative, multiply `ans` by -1 to flip the sign.
3. **Step 3**: After iterating through all elements, return the value of `ans` which will be 1 if the product is positive, -1 if negative, or 0 if any element was zero.

> **Example**: Using a single loop, we check each element and update the sign accordingly. If a zero is encountered, we return 0 immediately.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The solution involves a single pass through the array, making it linear in terms of the number of elements.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
     def arraySign(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
          ans = 1
          for num in nums:
                if num > 0:
                     ans *= 1
                if num == 0:
                     return 0
                if num < 0:
                     ans *= -1
          return ans
```

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [-1, -2, -3, -4, 3, 2, 1]
Output = 1

# Test case 2
parameters = [1, 5, 0, 2, -3]
Output = 0

# Test case 3
parameters = [-1, 1, -1, 1, -1]
Output = -1
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Count Negatives
- Count the number of negative elements and check if it is odd or even.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Simple and easy to understand.
- Cons: Requires an additional pass to count negatives.

```python
class Solution:
     def arraySign(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
          neg_count = sum(1 for num in nums if num < 0)
          return 0 if 0 in nums else -1 if neg_count % 2 else 1
```

### Alternative 2: Use Built-in Functions
- Use Python's built-in functions to determine the product and then check its sign.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Concise and leverages built-in functionality.
- Cons: May not be as efficient for large arrays due to intermediate product calculation.

```python
import math
class Solution:
     def arraySign(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
          product = math.prod(nums)
          return 0 if product == 0 else 1 if product > 0 else -1
```

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Forgetting to handle the zero case can lead to incorrect results.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The `math.prod` function in Python can be used to calculate the product of an array.
