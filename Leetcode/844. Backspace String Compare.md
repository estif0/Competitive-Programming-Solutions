# Solution to [Backspace String Compare](https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution involves simulating the backspace operation on both input strings and then comparing the final processed strings. We use a stack to handle the backspace operations efficiently.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Define a helper function `finalString` that processes a string to simulate the backspace operations.
2. **Step 2**: Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters.
3. **Step 3**: Iterate through each character in the string:
   - If the character is not a backspace (`#`), push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a backspace and the stack is not empty, pop the top character from the stack.
4. **Step 4**: Join the characters in the stack to form the final processed string.
5. **Step 5**: Compare the processed versions of both input strings and return `True` if they are equal, otherwise return `False`.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N)
  - The solution processes each character in the input strings exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N)
  - The space used by the stack is proportional to the length of the input strings.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
     def backspaceCompare(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
          def finalString(strin):
                stack = []
                for char in strin:
                     if char != "#":
                          stack.append(char)
                     else:
                          if stack:
                                stack.pop()
                return ''.join(stack)
          return finalString(s) == finalString(t)
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
s = "ab#c"
t = "ad#c"
Output = True  # Both strings become "ac"

# Test case 2
s = "ab##"
t = "c#d#"
Output = True  # Both strings become ""

# Test case 3
s = "a#c"
t = "b"
Output = False  # "a#c" becomes "c" and "b" remains "b"
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Two Pointer Approach

- Use two pointers to traverse the strings from the end to the beginning, skipping characters as needed.
- **Complexity**: O(N) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: More space-efficient as it does not use additional data structures.
- Cons: Slightly more complex to implement.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the backspace operations are correctly simulated, especially when multiple backspaces are present consecutively.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The stack-based approach can be reused for similar problems involving backspace operations.
