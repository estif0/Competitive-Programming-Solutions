## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The problem is about finding the first bad version in a sequence of versions. The approach involves using a binary search to efficiently narrow down the range and find the first bad version.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Initialize two pointers, `left` at the first version and `right` at the last version.
2. **Step 2**: Perform a binary search by calculating the mid-point between `left` and `right`.
3. **Step 3**: Use the API `isBadVersion(mid)` to check if the mid-point version is bad.
4. **Step 4**: If `mid` is a bad version, move the `right` pointer to `mid`, as the first bad version could be to the left.
5. **Step 5**: If `mid` is not a bad version, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`, as the first bad version must be to the right.
6. **Step 6**: Repeat until `left` equals `right`, which will point to the first bad version.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
  - *The time complexity is logarithmic because we are using binary search to find the first bad version.*
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - *The space complexity is constant because we are not using any extra space.*

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        left, right = 1, n
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if isBadVersion(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```

---

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
n = 5
first_bad_version = 4
# Assuming isBadVersion(4) returns True, isBadVersion(3) returns False
Output: 4

# Test case 2
n = 1
first_bad_version = 1
# Assuming isBadVersion(1) returns True
Output: 1
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Linear Search
- Check each version from 1 to n to find the first bad version.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- *Much slower compared to binary search, especially for large n.*

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure the mid-point calculation is performed without overflow for large values of `n`.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: Binary search is a common technique for problems involving sorted or sequential data.
- **Related Problems**: Consider similar problems like "Find Peak Element" or other binary search problems for additional practice.
