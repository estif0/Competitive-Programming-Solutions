# Solution to [Top K Frequent Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Medium

---

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution involves counting the frequency of each word in the input list and then sorting the words based on their frequency and lexicographical order.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Count the frequency of each word using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.
2. **Step 2**: Use the `most_common` method of the `Counter` class to get a list of words sorted by their frequency in descending order.
3. **Step 3**: Sort the list of words by frequency in descending order and by lexicographical order for words with the same frequency.
4. **Step 4**: Extract the top `k` words from the sorted list and return them.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N log N)
  - The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, where N is the number of unique words.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N)
  - Space is used to store the frequency count and the sorted list of words.

## Code Implementation

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class Solution:
        def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
                count = Counter(words)
                wFreq = count.most_common()
                wFreq.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
                return [word for word, freq in wFreq[:k]]
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = (["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], 2)
Output = ["i", "love"]

# Test case 2
parameters = (["the", "day", "is", "sunny", "the", "the", "the", "sunny", "is", "is"], 4)
Output = ["the", "is", "sunny", "day"]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Using a Heap

- Use a heap to keep track of the top k elements.
- **Complexity**: O(N log k) Time | O(N) Space
- Pros: More efficient for large values of k.
- Cons: More complex to implement.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that words with the same frequency are sorted lexicographically.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The `Counter` class and `most_common` method are very useful for frequency counting problems.
