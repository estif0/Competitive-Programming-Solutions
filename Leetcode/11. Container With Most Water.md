# Solution to [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

---

## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Medium  

---

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The solution uses a two-pointer technique to find the maximum area of water that can be contained. The main idea is to start with the widest container and then reduce the width while trying to find a taller container.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Initialize two pointers, `left` at the beginning and `right` at the end of the array.
2. **Step 2**: Calculate the area formed between the two pointers and update the maximum area if the current area is larger.
3. **Step 3**: Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward, as this might increase the height of the container and potentially the area.

> **Example**: If the height at the `left` pointer is less than or equal to the height at the `right` pointer, increment the `left` pointer. Otherwise, decrement the `right` pointer.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
    - The algorithm only requires a single pass through the array, making it linear in time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
    - The solution uses a constant amount of extra space.

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
        def maxArea(self, h: List[int]) -> int:
                left, right = 0, len(h) - 1
                max_vol = 0
                while left < right:
                        v = min(h[left], h[right]) * (right - left)
                        max_vol = max(v, max_vol)
                        if h[left] <= h[right]:
                                left += 1
                        else:
                                right -= 1
                return max_vol
```

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output = 49

# Test case 2
parameters = [1,1]
Output = 1
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Brute Force
- Iterate over all possible pairs of lines and calculate the area for each pair.
- **Complexity**: O(n^2) Time | O(1) Space
- This approach is simpler but less efficient compared to the two-pointer technique.

### Alternative 2: Dynamic Programming
- Use dynamic programming to store intermediate results.
- This approach is generally not used for this problem due to its higher complexity.

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the pointers are moved correctly to avoid infinite loops or incorrect results.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The two-pointer technique is useful for problems involving pairs of elements in a sorted or unsorted array.
