# Solution to [125. Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

---

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution involves using two pointers to check if the given string is a palindrome by ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and considering case insensitivity.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Initialize two pointers, `left` at the start of the string and `right` at the end.
2. **Step 2**: Iterate through the string with the two pointers:
   - If the character at `left` is not alphanumeric, increment `left`.
   - If the character at `right` is not alphanumeric, decrement `right`.
   - Compare the characters at `left` and `right` after converting them to lowercase. If they are not equal, return `False`.
   - Move the `left` pointer to the right and the `right` pointer to the left.
3. **Step 3**: If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, return `True`.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The algorithm processes each character in the string at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only a constant amount of extra space is used for the pointers.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
     def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
          left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
          while left < right:
                if not s[left].isalnum():
                     left += 1
                     continue
                if not s[right].isalnum():
                     right -= 1
                     continue
                if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():
                     return False
                left += 1
                right -= 1
          return True
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output = True

# Test case 2
parameters = "race a car"
Output = False
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Using Regular Expressions

- Use regular expressions to filter out non-alphanumeric characters and then check if the resulting string is a palindrome.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Cleaner code.
- Cons: Additional space for the filtered string.

### Alternative 2: Two-Pointer Approach with String Concatenation

- Concatenate alphanumeric characters into a new string and then use the two-pointer approach.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Simpler logic.
- Cons: Higher space usage.

  ```python
  class Solution:
      def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
          alphanumeric = ''.join(ch.lower() for ch in s if ch.isalnum())
          left, right = 0, len(alphanumeric) - 1
          while left < right:
              if alphanumeric[left] != alphanumeric[right]:
                  return False
              left += 1
              right -= 1
          return True
  ```

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Forgetting to handle case insensitivity or non-alphanumeric characters.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The `isalnum()` method checks if a character is alphanumeric.
