# Solution to [1464. Maximum Product of Two Elements in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-two-elements-in-an-array/)

---

## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy  

---

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The main idea is to find the two largest elements in the array, reduce each by one, and then return the product of these two reduced values.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Sort the array in ascending order.
2. **Step 2**: Identify the two largest elements in the sorted array, which will be the last two elements.
3. **Step 3**: Subtract one from each of these two elements and return their product.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
    - Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
    - The solution uses constant extra space.

---

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
        def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                nums.sort()
                return (nums[-1]-1)*(nums[-2]-1)
```

---

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [3, 4, 5, 2]
Output = 12

# Test case 2
parameters = [1, 5, 4, 5]
Output = 16

# Test case 3
parameters = [10, 2, 5, 2]
Output = 36
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Using a Single Pass
- Instead of sorting, iterate through the array to find the two largest elements in a single pass.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: More efficient in terms of time complexity.
- Cons: Slightly more complex to implement.

    ```python
    class Solution:
            def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                    max1, max2 = float('-inf'), float('-inf')
                    for num in nums:
                            if num > max1:
                                    max2 = max1
                                    max1 = num
                            elif num > max2:
                                    max2 = num
                    return (max1-1)*(max2-1)
    ```

### Alternative 2: Using a Max-Heap
- Use a max-heap to extract the two largest elements.
- **Complexity**: O(n log n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Can be useful if the array is very large and we need to find the largest elements multiple times.
- Cons: Higher space complexity.

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure the array has at least two elements to avoid index errors.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: Sorting can be replaced with a more efficient algorithm if needed.
