# Solution to [Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution uses an insertion sort algorithm to sort the colors in-place. The main idea is to iterate through the list and insert each element into its correct position relative to the already sorted portion of the list.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Initialize the length of the list `n`.
2. **Step 2**: Iterate through the list starting from the second element.
3. **Step 3**: For each element, compare it with the elements in the sorted portion of the list and swap if necessary to insert it into the correct position.
4. **Step 4**: Continue this process until the entire list is sorted.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2)
  - The worst-case time complexity is quadratic because each insertion operation can take up to O(n) time in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The algorithm sorts the list in-place, so no additional space is required beyond the input list.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
                """
                Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
                """
                n = len(nums)
                for i in range(1, n):
                        j = i
                        while j > 0 and nums[j-1] > nums[j]:
                                nums[j-1], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[j-1]
                                j -= 1
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]
Output = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]

# Test case 2
parameters = [2, 0, 1]
Output = [0, 1, 2]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Counting Sort

- Count the occurrences of each color and then overwrite the original list based on the counts.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Simple and efficient.
- Cons: Requires two passes over the list.

  ```python
  class Solution:
          def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
                  """
                  Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
                  """
                  counts = [0, 0, 0]
                  for num in nums:
                          counts[num] += 1
                  i = 0
                  for color, count in enumerate(counts):
                          for _ in range(count):
                                  nums[i] = color
                                  i += 1
  ```

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the list is modified in-place and handle edge cases like empty lists or lists with all elements the same.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The insertion sort algorithm is useful for small or nearly sorted lists.
