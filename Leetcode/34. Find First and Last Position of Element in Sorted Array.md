# Solution to [34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Medium

---

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution leverages binary search to efficiently find the first and last positions of a given element in a sorted array. By using the `bisect` module, we can quickly locate the insertion points which correspond to the desired positions.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Check if the key is present in the array. If not, return `[-1, -1]`.
2. **Step 2**: Use `bisect.bisect_left` to find the first occurrence of the key.
3. **Step 3**: Use `bisect.bisect_right` to find the position just after the last occurrence of the key and subtract one to get the last occurrence.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
  - The binary search operations performed by `bisect_left` and `bisect_right` each take O(log n) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution uses a constant amount of extra space.

## Code Implementation

```python
import bisect
from typing import List

class Solution:
        def searchRange(self, arr: List[int], key: int) -> List[int]:
                if key not in arr:
                        return [-1, -1]
                else:
                        return [bisect.bisect_left(arr, key), bisect.bisect_right(arr, key) - 1]
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = ([5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], 8)
Output = [3, 4]

# Test case 2
parameters = ([5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], 6)
Output = [-1, -1]

# Test case 3
parameters = ([], 0)
Output = [-1, -1]

# Test case 4
parameters = ([1], 1)
Output = [0, 0]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Linear Search

- Iterate through the array to find the first and last positions of the key.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- This approach is simpler but less efficient for large arrays.

### Alternative 2: Two-Pointer Technique

- Use two pointers to find the first and last positions in a single pass.
- This method can be more intuitive but may not be as efficient as binary search.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure the array is sorted before applying binary search. Handle edge cases where the array is empty or the key is not present.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The `bisect` module is useful for various binary search operations in sorted arrays.
