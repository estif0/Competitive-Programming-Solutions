# Solution to [1281. Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtract-the-product-and-sum-of-digits-of-an-integer/)

---

## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy  

---

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The solution involves converting the integer into its individual digits, calculating the product and sum of these digits, and then returning the difference between the product and the sum.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Convert the integer `n` into a list of its digits.
2. **Step 2**: Calculate the sum of the digits.
3. **Step 3**: Calculate the product of the digits.
4. **Step 4**: Return the difference between the product and the sum.

> **Example**: For `n = 234`, the digits are `[2, 3, 4]`. The sum is `2 + 3 + 4 = 9`, and the product is `2 * 3 * 4 = 24`. The result is `24 - 9 = 15`.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(d)
    - The time complexity is linear with respect to the number of digits `d` in the integer `n`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(d)
    - The space complexity is also linear due to the storage of the digits in a list.

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
        def subtractProductAndSum(self, n: int) -> int:
                lst = [int(i) for i in str(n)]
                sm = sum(lst)
                prod = 1
                for num in lst:
                        prod *= num
                return prod - sm
```

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
parameters = 234
Output = 15

# Test case 2
parameters = 4421
Output = 21
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Using Mathematical Operations
- Instead of converting to a list, use mathematical operations to extract digits.
- **Complexity**: O(d) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Reduced space complexity.
- Cons: Slightly more complex code.
```python
class Solution:
        def subtractProductAndSum(self, n: int) -> int:
                sm, prod = 0, 1
                while n:
                        n, digit = divmod(n, 10)
                        sm += digit
                        prod *= digit
                return prod - sm
```

### Alternative 2: Using Functional Programming
- Use `reduce` from `functools` to calculate the product.
- **Complexity**: O(d) Time | O(d) Space
- Pros: More concise code.
- Cons: May be less readable for beginners.
```python
from functools import reduce
class Solution:
        def subtractProductAndSum(self, n: int) -> int:
                lst = [int(i) for i in str(n)]
                sm = sum(lst)
                prod = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, lst)
                return prod - sm
```

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the product calculation handles zeros correctly.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: 
    - The `reduce` function from `functools` can be useful for product calculations.
    - The `divmod` function can be used to extract digits from an integer.
