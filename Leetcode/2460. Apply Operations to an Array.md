# Solution to [2460. Apply Operations to an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-operations-to-an-array/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

---

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution involves two main passes through the array. The first pass combines adjacent equal elements by doubling the first and setting the second to zero. The second pass moves all non-zero elements to the front, maintaining their relative order.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Iterate through the array with two pointers, `left` and `right`. If `nums[left]` equals `nums[right]`, double `nums[left]` and set `nums[right]` to zero. Increment both pointers.
2. **Step 2**: Use two pointers, `holder` and `seeker`, to move non-zero elements to the front. If `nums[holder]` is zero and `nums[seeker]` is non-zero, swap them. Increment `holder` if it points to a non-zero element. Always increment `seeker`.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The solution involves two linear passes through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution uses a constant amount of extra space.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def applyOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
                n = len(nums)

                left, right = 0, 1
                while right < n:
                        if nums[left] == nums[right]:
                                nums[left] *= 2
                                nums[right] = 0
                        left += 1
                        right += 1

                holder, seeker = 0, 0
                while seeker < n:
                        if nums[holder] == 0 and nums[seeker] != 0:
                                nums[holder], nums[seeker] = nums[seeker], nums[holder]
                        if nums[holder] != 0:
                                holder += 1
                        seeker += 1

                return nums
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0]
Output = [1, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0]

# Test case 2
parameters = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0]
Output = [2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Description

- Use a single pass with a more complex condition to handle both combining and moving non-zero elements.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Potentially faster in practice due to fewer passes.
- Cons: More complex and harder to understand.

### Alternative 2: Description

- Use additional data structures like queues to manage the positions of non-zero elements.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Simplifies the logic.
- Cons: Uses additional space.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the second pass correctly maintains the order of non-zero elements.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The two-pointer technique is useful for in-place array modifications.
