# Solution to [344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea behind this solution is to use two pointers to reverse the string in place. One pointer starts at the beginning of the string, and the other starts at the end. The characters at these pointers are swapped, and the pointers move towards each other until they meet in the middle.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Set `left` pointer to the start of the string and `right` pointer to the end of the string.
2. **Swap Characters**: While `left` is less than `right`, swap the characters at the `left` and `right` pointers.
3. **Move Pointers**: Increment the `left` pointer and decrement the `right` pointer.
4. **Repeat**: Continue the process until the `left` pointer is no longer less than the `right` pointer.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The algorithm iterates through the string once, performing a constant-time swap operation for each character.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution uses a constant amount of extra space for the pointers.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
                """
                Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
                """
                left, right = 0, len(s) - 1  # Initialize pointers
                while left < right:
                        s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]  # swap the two characters
                        left += 1  # bring the pointer forward
                        right -= 1  # bring the pointer backward
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
Output = ["o", "l", "l", "e", "h"]

# Test case 2
parameters = ["H", "a", "n", "n", "a", "h"]
Output = ["h", "a", "n", "n", "a", "H"]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Using Recursion

- A recursive approach can also be used to reverse the string by swapping characters and making recursive calls with updated pointers.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Elegant and concise.
- Cons: Uses additional stack space due to recursion.

### Alternative 2: Using Python's Built-in Functions

- Python's slicing can reverse the string in a single line: `s[:] = s[::-1]`.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Very concise.
- Cons: Uses additional space for the slice.

### Alternative 3: Using python's reverse() method

- Python's built-in `reverse()` method can be used to reverse the list in place.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Simple and concise.
- Cons: Modifies the original list.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the pointers are correctly initialized and updated to avoid infinite loops or index errors.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The two-pointer technique is useful for many other problems involving arrays or strings.
