# Solution to [151. Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)

---

## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Medium  

---

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The main idea behind the solution is to split the input string into words, reverse the order of the words, and then join them back into a single string.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Split the input string `s` into a list of words using the `split()` method.
2. **Step 2**: Reverse the list of words using the `reverse()` method.
3. **Step 3**: Join the reversed list of words into a single string with spaces in between using the `join()` method.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
    - The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input string. This is because splitting the string, reversing the list, and joining the words all take linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
    - The space complexity is O(n) due to the additional space required to store the list of words.

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
        def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
                l = [i for i in s.split()]
                l.reverse()
                return " ".join(l)
```

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
parameters = "the sky is blue"
Output = "blue is sky the"

# Test case 2
parameters = "  hello world  "
Output = "world hello"

# Test case 3
parameters = "a good   example"
Output = "example good a"
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Using Built-in Functions
- Instead of manually reversing the list, use Python's slicing feature to reverse the list.(It )
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: More concise code.
- Cons: Less explicit about the reversing step.
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
            return " ".join(s.split()[::-1])
    ```

### Alternative 2: Manual Reversal
- Manually reverse the list by swapping elements.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Demonstrates understanding of list manipulation.
- Cons: More code and potentially less readable.

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure to handle leading, trailing, and multiple spaces between words correctly.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The `split()` method without arguments handles multiple spaces and trims leading/trailing spaces.
