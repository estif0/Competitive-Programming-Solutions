## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution involves using a sliding window approach to find the maximum sum of subarrays with distinct elements of length `k`. The main idea is to maintain a window of size `k` and ensure all elements within the window are unique.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Initialize Variables**: Create a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of elements in the current window, and variables `start`, `wind_sum`, and `max_sum` to manage the window's start index, current window sum, and maximum sum found, respectively.
2. **Expand the Window**: Iterate through the array with an `end` pointer. For each element, update its frequency in `freq` and add its value to `wind_sum`.
3. **Check Window Size**: Once the window size reaches `k`, check if all elements are unique by comparing the size of `freq` with `k`. If they are unique, update `max_sum` if `wind_sum` is greater.
4. **Shrink the Window**: Remove the element at the `start` index from `wind_sum` and update its frequency in `freq`. If its frequency becomes zero, remove it from `freq`. Increment the `start` index to shrink the window.
5. **Return Result**: After processing all elements, return `max_sum`.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The algorithm processes each element of the array once, making it linear in time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k)
  - The space complexity is determined by the dictionary `freq`, which stores at most `k` elements.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def maximumSubarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
                freq = {}
                start, wind_sum, max_sum = 0, 0, 0
                for end, num in enumerate(nums):
                        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
                        wind_sum += num
                        if end >= k - 1:
                                if len(freq) == k:
                                        max_sum = max(max_sum, wind_sum)
                                wind_sum -= nums[start]
                                freq[nums[start]] -= 1
                                if freq[nums[start]] == 0:
                                        del freq[nums[start]]
                                start += 1
                return max_sum
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)
Output = 12  # The subarray [3, 4, 5] has the maximum sum of 12 with distinct elements.

# Test case 2
parameters = ([4, 4, 4, 4], 1)
Output = 4  # The subarray [4] has the maximum sum of 4 with distinct elements.

# Test case 3
parameters = ([1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], 2)
Output = 3  # The subarray [1, 2] has the maximum sum of 3 with distinct elements.
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Brute Force

- Iterate through all possible subarrays of length `k` and check if they contain distinct elements. Calculate their sums and keep track of the maximum sum.
- **Complexity**: O(n\*k) Time | O(k) Space
- This approach is less efficient compared to the sliding window method.

### Alternative 2: Using Set

- Use a set to maintain unique elements within the window and adjust the window size accordingly.
- This approach can be more intuitive but may have similar complexity to the sliding window method.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure the window size is exactly `k` and all elements within the window are unique.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The sliding window technique is useful for problems involving subarrays or substrings with specific constraints.
