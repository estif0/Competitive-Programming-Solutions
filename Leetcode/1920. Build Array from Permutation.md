# Solution to [1920. Build Array from Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/build-array-from-permutation/)

---

## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy  

---

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The main idea is to create a new array where each element at index `i` is assigned the value of `nums[nums[i]]`. This can be efficiently achieved using list comprehension in Python.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Initialize the result array using list comprehension.
2. **Step 2**: Iterate over each index `i` in the input array `nums`.
3. **Step 3**: For each index `i`, assign the value `nums[nums[i]]` to the result array.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
    - The solution involves a single pass through the input array, making it linear in time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
    - The space complexity is linear due to the creation of the result array of the same size as the input array.

---

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
        def buildArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
                return [nums[i] for i in nums]
```

---

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [0,2,1,5,3,4]
Output = [0,1,2,4,5,3]

# Test case 2
parameters = [5,0,1,2,3,4]
Output = [4,5,0,1,2,3]
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Using a for loop
- Instead of list comprehension, a for loop can be used to achieve the same result.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: More readable for beginners.
- Cons: Slightly more verbose than list comprehension.

### Alternative 2: In-place modification (if allowed)
- Modify the input array in place to save space.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Saves space.
- Cons: Modifies the input array, which might not be allowed in some cases.

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the input array `nums` is a valid permutation of indices.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: List comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python.
