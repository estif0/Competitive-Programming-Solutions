# Solution to [1636. Sort Array by Increasing Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-increasing-frequency/)

---

## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy  

---

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The main idea is to count the frequency of each number in the array and then sort the array based on these frequencies. If two numbers have the same frequency, the number with the higher value comes first.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Count the frequency of each number in the array using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.
2. **Step 2**: Sort the array using a custom key. The key is a tuple where the first element is the frequency of the number (to sort by frequency) and the second element is the negative of the number (to sort by value in descending order when frequencies are the same).
3. **Step 3**: Return the sorted array.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
    - Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
    - The space complexity is O(n) due to the space required to store the frequency count.

## Code Implementation
```python
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
        def frequencySort(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
                counter = Counter(nums)
                nums.sort(key=lambda x: (counter[x], -x))
                return nums
```

---

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
Output = [3,1,1,2,2,2]

# Test case 2
parameters = [2,3,1,3,2]
Output = [1,3,3,2,2]

# Test case 3
parameters = [-1,1,-6,4,5,-6,1,4,1]
Output = [5,-1,4,4,-6,-6,1,1,1]
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Using a Dictionary and Sorting
- Instead of using `Counter`, manually count frequencies using a dictionary and then sort.
- **Complexity**: O(n log n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: More control over counting process.
- Cons: More code and potentially more error-prone.

### Alternative 2: Bucket Sort
- Use bucket sort to group numbers by frequency and then sort within each bucket.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Can be faster for certain input sizes.
- Cons: More complex to implement.

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the custom sort key correctly handles both frequency and value sorting.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The `Counter` class from `collections` is very useful for counting frequencies.
