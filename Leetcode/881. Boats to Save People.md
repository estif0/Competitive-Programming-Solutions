## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The main idea is to use a two-pointer approach to pair the heaviest person with the lightest person who can still fit in the boat with them. By sorting the list of people's weights, we can efficiently determine the optimal pairing to minimize the number of boats needed.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Sort the list of people's weights in ascending order.
2. **Step 2**: Initialize two pointers, `left` at the start (lightest person) and `right` at the end (heaviest person) of the sorted list.
3. **Step 3**: Iterate while `left` pointer is less than or equal to `right` pointer:
    - If the sum of weights of the people at `left` and `right` pointers is less than or equal to the limit, increment the `left` pointer (indicating that the lightest person has been paired).
    - Always decrement the `right` pointer (indicating that the heaviest person has been placed in a boat).
    - Increment the boat count for each iteration.
4. **Step 4**: Return the total number of boats used.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
  - Sorting the list of people's weights takes O(n log n) time, and the two-pointer traversal takes O(n) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution uses a constant amount of extra space.

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
     def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
          boat, left, right = 0, 0, len(people) - 1
          people.sort()
          while left <= right:
                if people[right] + people[left] <= limit:
                     left += 1
                right -= 1
                boat += 1
          return boat
```

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [1, 2], 3
Output = 1

# Test case 2
parameters = [3, 2, 2, 1], 3
Output = 3

# Test case 3
parameters = [3, 5, 3, 4], 5
Output = 4
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Greedy Approach with Deque
- Use a deque to optimize the two-pointer approach.
- **Complexity**: O(n log n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Can be more intuitive with deque operations.
- Cons: Additional space usage for the deque.

### Alternative 2: Binary Search
- Use binary search to find the optimal number of boats.
- **Complexity**: O(n log n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Can be more efficient in some cases.
- Cons: More complex to implement.

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Forgetting to sort the list of people's weights can lead to incorrect results.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: Sorting and two-pointer techniques are commonly used in problems involving pairs.
