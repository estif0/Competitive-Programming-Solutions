# Solution to [451. Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)

---

## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Medium  

---

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The main idea is to count the frequency of each character in the string and then sort the characters by their frequency in descending order. Finally, construct the result string based on the sorted order of characters.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Count the frequency of each character in the string using a dictionary.
2. **Step 2**: Sort the dictionary by values (frequencies) in descending order.
3. **Step 3**: Construct the result string by repeating each character based on its frequency.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
    - The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
    - Additional space is used for the dictionary to store character frequencies and the result string.

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
        def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
                d = {}
                for char in s:
                        d[char] = d.get(char, 0) + 1
                sorted_dict = dict(sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True))
                ans = ''
                for key in sorted_dict:
                        ans += key * sorted_dict[key]
                return ans
```

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
parameters = "tree"
Output = "eert"  # or "eetr"

# Test case 2
parameters = "cccaaa"
Output = "cccaaa"  # or "aaaccc"

# Test case 3
parameters = "Aabb"
Output = "bbAa"  # or "bbaA"
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Bucket Sort
- Use a bucket sort approach where characters are grouped by their frequencies.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: More efficient for large input sizes.
- Cons: Slightly more complex to implement.

### Alternative 2: Using Collections.Counter
- Use `collections.Counter` to count frequencies and `most_common` method to sort.
- **Complexity**: O(n log n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Simplifies the counting and sorting steps.
- Cons: Requires importing an additional library.

    ```python
    from collections import Counter
    class Solution:
            def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
                    counter = Counter(s)
                    sorted_counter = counter.most_common()
                    ans = ''
                    for char, freq in sorted_counter:
                            ans += char * freq
                    return ans
    ```

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the sorting step correctly handles characters with the same frequency.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: 
    - The `collections.Counter` class can simplify frequency counting.
    - The `sorted` function can sort dictionaries based on values if written properly.
