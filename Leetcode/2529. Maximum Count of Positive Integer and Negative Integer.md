## Solution Overview

### General Overview

This problem is a basic binary search problem. We want to find the split position which divides the array into two parts, where the left part contains all negative numbers and the right part contains all positive numbers.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1: Get the counts of positive and negative numbers.** We can use the bisect.bisect_left and bisect.bisect_right functions in the bisect module in the standard library. The bisect_left function finds the insertion point for x in list to maintain sorted order. The bisect_right function returns an insertion point which comes after (to the right of) any existing entries of x in list. The insertion point is the index at which x should be inserted to maintain sorted order.
2. **Step 2: Get the counts of positive and negative numbers.** We can use the bisect.bisect_left and bisect.bisect_right functions in the bisect module in the standard library. The bisect_left function finds the insertion point for x in list to maintain sorted order. The bisect_right function returns an insertion point which comes after (to the right of) any existing entries of x in list. The insertion point is the index at which x should be inserted to maintain sorted order.
3. **Step 3: Get the counts of positive and negative numbers.** We can use the bisect.bisect_left and bisect.bisect_right functions in the bisect module in the standard library. The bisect_left function finds the insertion point for x in list to maintain sorted order. The bisect_right function returns an insertion point which comes after (to the right of) any existing entries of x in list. The insertion point is the index at which x should be inserted to maintain sorted order.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
  - The solution uses binary search operations, which are logarithmic in nature.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of space for variables `p` and `n`.

## Code Implementation

```python
import bisect
class Solution:
    def maximumCount(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        p=len(nums)-(bisect.bisect_right(nums,0))
        n=bisect.bisect_left(nums,0)
        return max(n,p)
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5]
Output = 3

# Test case 2
parameters = [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]
Output = 5
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Two-Pointer Technique

- Instead of using binary search, iterate through the list with two pointers to count negative and positive numbers.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Simpler and more intuitive for those unfamiliar with `bisect`.
- Cons: Less efficient than the binary search approach for large sorted arrays.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure the list is sorted for the bisect functions to work correctly
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The `bisect` module can be helpful for similar problems involving sorted lists.
