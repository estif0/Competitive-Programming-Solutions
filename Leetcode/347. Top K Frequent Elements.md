# Solution to [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea behind the solution is to count the frequency of each element in the input list and then identify the top `k` elements with the highest frequency. This can be efficiently achieved using a hash map to store the frequencies and a heap to extract the top `k` frequent elements.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Count the frequency of each element in the input list using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.
2. **Step 2**: Use the `most_common` method of the `Counter` class to get the `k` most common elements.
3. **Step 3**: Extract the elements from the result of `most_common` and return them as the final answer.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N log k)
  - Counting the frequency of elements takes O(N) time. Extracting the top `k` elements using a heap takes O(N log k) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N)
  - The space complexity is O(N) due to the storage required for the frequency count.

## Code Implementation

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class Solution:
        def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
                count = Counter(nums)
                sNums = count.most_common(k)
                ans = [item[0] for item in sNums]
                return ans
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [1,1,1,2,2,3], 2
Output = [1, 2]

# Test case 2
parameters = [1], 1
Output = [1]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Using Bucket Sort

- Instead of using a heap, we can use bucket sort to group elements by their frequencies and then collect the top `k` frequent elements.
- **Complexity**: O(N) Time | O(N) Space
- Pros: Simpler implementation for certain cases.
- Cons: May not be as intuitive as the heap-based approach.

### Alternative 2: Using Quickselect

- Quickselect can be used to find the `k`th most frequent element and partition the list accordingly.
- **Complexity**: O(N) Time on average | O(N) Space
- Pros: Efficient on average.
- Cons: More complex to implement and worst-case time complexity is O(N^2).

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the input list is not empty and `k` is within the valid range.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The `Counter` class and its `most_common` method are very useful for frequency counting problems.
