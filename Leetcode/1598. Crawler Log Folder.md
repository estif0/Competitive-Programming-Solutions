# Solution to [Crawler Log Folder](https://leetcode.com/problems/crawler-log-folder/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode
**Difficulty**: Easy

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution involves simulating the operations of a file system crawler using a stack. Each log entry represents a command that either moves up one directory, stays in the current directory, or moves into a subdirectory. The stack helps keep track of the current directory depth.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Initialize an empty stack**: This stack will be used to keep track of the current directory depth.
2. **Iterate through each log entry**:
   - If the log entry is `'../'`, pop the stack if it's not empty (move up one directory).
   - If the log entry is `'./'`, do nothing (stay in the current directory).
   - Otherwise, push the log entry onto the stack (move into a subdirectory).
3. **Return the size of the stack**: The size of the stack represents the current depth of the directory.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The solution iterates through each log entry once, performing constant-time operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The stack can grow up to the size of the input logs in the worst case.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
     def minOperations(self, logs: List[str]) -> int:
          stack = []
          for cmd in logs:
                if cmd == '../':
                     if stack:
                          stack.pop()
                elif cmd == './':
                     continue
                else:
                     stack.append(cmd)
          return len(stack)
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
logs = ["d1/", "d2/", "../", "d21/", "./"]
Output = 2

# Test case 2
logs = ["d1/", "d2/", "./", "d3/", "../", "d31/"]
Output = 3

# Test case 3
logs = ["d1/", "../", "../", "../"]
Output = 0
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Using a Counter

- Instead of using a stack, a counter can be used to keep track of the current directory depth.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Slightly more space-efficient.
- Cons: Less intuitive than using a stack.

  ```python
  class Solution:
       def minOperations(self, logs: List[str]) -> int:
            depth = 0
            for cmd in logs:
                  if cmd == '../':
                       depth = max(0, depth - 1)
                  elif cmd != './':
                       depth += 1
            return depth
  ```

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the stack is not popped when it's empty to avoid errors.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The stack-based approach is a common pattern for problems involving nested structures or backtracking.
