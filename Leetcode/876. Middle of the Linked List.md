# Solution to [876. Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

---

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution uses the two-pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list. One pointer moves twice as fast as the other, ensuring that when the faster pointer reaches the end, the slower pointer is at the middle.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers, `s` (slow) and `f` (fast), both pointing to the head of the linked list.
2. **Traverse the List**: Move `s` one step at a time and `f` two steps at a time.
3. **Find the Middle**: When `f` reaches the end of the list, `s` will be at the middle node.
4. **Return the Result**: Return the node where `s` is pointing.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The list is traversed once, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only a constant amount of extra space is used for the two pointers.

## Code Implementation

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
        def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
                s = head
                f = head

                while f is not None and f.next is not None:
                        s = s.next
                        f = f.next.next

                return s
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output = 3

# Test case 2
parameters = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output = 4
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Two Pass Approach

- Traverse the list to count the number of nodes, then traverse again to the middle.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- _Pros_: Simple to implement.
- _Cons_: Requires two passes through the list.

### Alternative 2: Using a List

- Store nodes in a list and return the middle element.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- _Pros_: Easy to understand.
- _Cons_: Requires extra space.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure to handle edge cases where the list is empty or has only one node.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The two-pointer technique is useful for many linked list problems.
