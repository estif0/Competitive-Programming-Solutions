# Solution to [349. Intersection of Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode
**Difficulty**: Easy

---

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution involves iterating through one array and checking for the presence of each element in the second array. If an element is found in both arrays and hasn't been added to the result list yet, it is appended to the result list.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Initialize an empty list `ans` to store the intersection of the two arrays.
2. **Step 2**: Iterate through each element `i` in `nums1`.
3. **Step 3**: For each element `i`, check if it is present in `nums2` and not already in `ans`. If both conditions are met, append `i` to `ans`.
4. **Step 4**: Return the list `ans` as the result.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n \* m)
  - The time complexity is O(n \* m) where n is the length of `nums1` and m is the length of `nums2` because for each element in `nums1`, we check its presence in `nums2`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of unique elements in the intersection, as we store the result in the list `ans`.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def intersection(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
                ans = []
                for i in nums1:
                        if i in nums2 and i not in ans:
                                ans.append(i)
                return ans
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = ([1, 2, 2, 1], [2, 2])
Output = [2]

# Test case 2
parameters = ([4, 9, 5], [9, 4, 9, 8, 4])
Output = [4, 9]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Using Set Intersection

- Use Python's set data structure to find the intersection.
- **Complexity**: O(n + m) Time | O(n + m) Space
- Pros: More efficient in terms of time complexity.
- Cons: Requires additional space for sets.

  ```python
  class Solution:
      def intersection(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
          return list(set(nums1) & set(nums2))
  ```

### Alternative 2: Two-Pointer Technique

- Sort both arrays and use two pointers to find the intersection.
- **Complexity**: O(n log n + m log m) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Efficient in terms of space complexity.
- Cons: Requires sorting the arrays.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the result list does not contain duplicate elements.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: Using sets can simplify the implementation and improve efficiency.
