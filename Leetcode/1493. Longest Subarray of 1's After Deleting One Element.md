# Solution to [1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subarray-of-1s-after-deleting-one-element/)

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea is to use a sliding window approach to find the longest subarray of 1's that can be obtained by deleting at most one element. We maintain a frequency dictionary to keep track of the number of zeros in the current window.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Initialize two pointers `start` and `end` to represent the window's boundaries, and a dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of elements within the window.
2. **Step 2**: Iterate through the array with the `end` pointer, expanding the window by including the current element and updating the frequency dictionary.
3. **Step 3**: If the count of zeros in the window exceeds one, shrink the window from the left by moving the `start` pointer until the count of zeros is at most one.
4. **Step 4**: Update the maximum length of the subarray found so far.
5. **Step 5**: Return the maximum length minus one to account for the deletion of one element.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The algorithm processes each element of the array at most twice (once when expanding the window and once when shrinking it).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The space used by the frequency dictionary is constant since it only stores counts of 0 and 1.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def longestSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                start, max_len = 0, 0
                freq = {}
                for end, num in enumerate(nums):
                        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1

                        if freq.get(0, 0) > 1:
                                left = nums[start]
                                freq[left] -= 1
                                if freq[left] == 0:
                                        del freq[left]
                                start += 1
                        max_len = max(max_len, end - start + 1)
                return max_len - 1
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [1,1,0,1]
Output = 3

# Test case 2
parameters = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output = 5

# Test case 3
parameters = [1,1,1]
Output = 2

# Test case 4
parameters = [1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1]
Output = 4
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Two-Pointer Approach

- Instead of using a frequency dictionary, maintain a count of zeros directly and adjust the window size accordingly.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Simpler implementation without the need for a dictionary.
- Cons: Slightly less intuitive to understand the window adjustments.

  ```python
  class Solution:
          def longestSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                  start, max_len, zero_count = 0, 0, 0
                  for end, num in enumerate(nums):
                          if num == 0:
                                  zero_count += 1
                          while zero_count > 1:
                                  if nums[start] == 0:
                                          zero_count -= 1
                                  start += 1
                          max_len = max(max_len, end - start)
                  return max_len
  ```

### Alternative 2: Prefix Sum Approach

- Use prefix sums to precompute the number of 1's up to each index and then find the longest subarray by considering deletions.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Can be useful if additional queries on the subarray are needed.
- Cons: Higher space complexity due to the prefix sum array.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure to handle edge cases where the array has no zeros or only one element.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: Sliding window techniques are useful for problems involving subarrays or substrings with specific constraints.
