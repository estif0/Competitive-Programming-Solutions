# Solution to [27. Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea is to use two pointers to remove all instances of a specific value in-place and return the new length of the array. One pointer iterates through the array, while the other keeps track of the position to place the next non-target element.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Initialize a pointer `left` to 0, which will track the position to place the next non-target element.
2. **Step 2**: Iterate through the array with a pointer `right`. For each element, check if it is not equal to the target value `val`.
3. **Step 3**: If the current element is not equal to `val`, assign it to the position indicated by `left` and increment `left`.
4. **Step 4**: Continue this process until the end of the array. The value of `left` will be the new length of the array without the target elements.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The algorithm iterates through the array once, making it linear in time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, as it modifies the array in-place.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
                left = 0
                for right in range(len(nums)):
                        if nums[right] != val:
                                nums[left] = nums[right]
                                left += 1
                return left
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = ([3, 2, 2, 3], 3)
Output = 2  # The array becomes [2, 2, _, _]

# Test case 2
parameters = ([0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 4, 2], 2)
Output = 5  # The array becomes [0, 1, 3, 0, 4, _, _, _]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Using List Comprehension

- Create a new list excluding the target value and return its length.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Simple and concise.
- Cons: Uses extra space.

  ```python
  class Solution:
      def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
          nums[:] = [num for num in nums if num != val]
          return len(nums)
  ```

### Alternative 2: Using `remove()` Method

- Remove all instances of the target value using the `remove()` method.
- **Complexity**: O(n^2) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Simple to implement.
- Cons: Inefficient for large arrays.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure not to access out-of-bound indices and handle cases where all elements are the target value.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The two-pointer technique is useful for in-place modifications.
