## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The main idea is to count the number of odd numbers between two given integers, `low` and `high`. Depending on whether `low` and `high` are odd or even, the count is adjusted accordingly.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Define a helper function `io(num)` to check if a number is odd.
2. **Step 2**: Initialize a variable `ans` to store the count of odd numbers.
3. **Step 3**: Use conditional statements to handle different combinations of `low` and `high` being odd or even:
    - If both `low` and `high` are even, calculate the count as `(high - low) // 2`.
    - If `low` is even and `high` is odd, calculate the count as `(high - low) // 2 + 1`.
    - If `low` is odd and `high` is even, calculate the count as `(high - low) // 2 + 1`.
    - If both `low` and `high` are odd, calculate the count as `(high - low) // 2 + 1`.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution involves a constant number of operations regardless of the input size.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - No additional space is used apart from a few variables.

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
     def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:
          ans = 0
          def io(num):
                return num % 2 == 1
          # l=e h=e
          if not io(low) and not io(high):
                ans = (high - low) // 2
          # l=e h=o
          if not io(low) and io(high):
                ans = (high - low) // 2 + 1
          # l=o h=e
          if io(low) and not io(high):
                ans = (high - low) // 2 + 1
          # l=o h=o
          if io(low) and io(high):
                ans = (high - low) // 2 + 1
          return ans
```

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
parameters = (3, 7)
Output = 3

# Test case 2
parameters = (8, 10)
Output = 1
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Mathematical Approach
- Calculate the number of odds directly using the formula: `(high + 1) // 2 - low // 2`.
- **Complexity**: O(1) Time | O(1) Space
- This approach is more concise and avoids multiple conditional checks.

### Alternative 2: Iterative Approach
- Iterate from `low` to `high` and count the odd numbers.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- This approach is less efficient but straightforward.

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure to handle edge cases where `low` and `high` are the same.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The helper function `io(num)` can be reused to check for odd numbers in other problems.
