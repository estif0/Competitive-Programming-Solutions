# Solution to [217. Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)

---

## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy  

---

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The main idea behind this solution is to use a set to identify if there are any duplicate elements in the list. By converting the list to a set, we can leverage the property that sets do not allow duplicate values.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Convert the list `nums` to a set. This will remove any duplicate values.
2. **Step 2**: Compare the length of the set with the length of the original list. If they are not equal, it means there were duplicates in the list.
3. **Step 3**: Return `True` if duplicates are found (i.e., lengths are not equal), otherwise return `False`.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
    - The time complexity is linear because converting a list to a set and comparing lengths both take O(n) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
    - The space complexity is linear because we are using a set to store the elements of the list, which in the worst case will store all n elements.

---

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
        def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
                return not (len(set(nums)) == len(nums))
```

---

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [1, 2, 3, 1]
Output = True

# Test case 2
parameters = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output = False

# Test case 3
parameters = [1, 1, 1, 1]
Output = True

# Test case 4
parameters = []
Output = False
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Using a HashMap
- Use a hash map to track the occurrences of each element. If an element is found more than once, return `True`.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Easy to understand and implement.
- Cons: Slightly more space usage compared to the set approach.

### Alternative 2: Sorting the List
- Sort the list and then check for consecutive duplicate elements.
- **Complexity**: O(n log n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Does not require additional space.
- Cons: Sorting takes more time compared to the set approach.

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Forgetting to handle edge cases such as an empty list.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The set approach is generally preferred for its simplicity and efficiency.
