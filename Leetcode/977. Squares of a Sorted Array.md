# Solution to [Squares of a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode
**Difficulty**: Easy

---

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea is to square each element in the array and then sort the resulting array. This approach leverages Python's built-in sorting functionality to achieve the desired result efficiently.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Iterate through each element in the input array.
2. **Step 2**: Square each element and store the results in a new list.
3. **Step 3**: Sort the new list of squared values to get the final sorted array.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
  - Sorting the array of squared values takes O(n log n) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - Additional space is used to store the squared values.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def sortedSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
                return sorted([num**2 for num in nums])
```

---

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [-4, -1, 0, 3, 10]
Output = [0, 1, 9, 16, 100]

# Test case 2
parameters = [-7, -3, 2, 3, 11]
Output = [4, 9, 9, 49, 121]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Two-Pointer Approach

- Use two pointers to compare the absolute values of elements from both ends of the array, square the larger value, and place it in the result array from the end to the beginning.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: More efficient in terms of time complexity.
- Cons: Slightly more complex to implement.

  ```python
        class Solution:
        def sortedSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
            n = len(nums)
            result = [0] * n  # Initialize the result array
            left, right = 0, n - 1
            pos = n - 1  # Position to fill in the result array

            while left <= right:
                if abs(nums[left]) > abs(nums[right]):
                    result[pos] = nums[left] ** 2
                    left += 1
                else:
                    result[pos] = nums[right] ** 2
                    right -= 1
                pos -= 1

            return result

  ```

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the input array is handled correctly when it contains negative numbers.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The two-pointer approach is a common technique for problems involving sorted arrays.
