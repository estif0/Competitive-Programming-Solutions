## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The problem is to find the integer square root of a non-negative integer `x`. The approach involves using binary search to efficiently find the largest integer `y` such that `y^2 <= x`.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Define a condition function that checks if `mid^2` is greater than `x`.
2. **Step 2**: Use binary search with pointers `left` starting at 1 and `right` at `x`.
3. **Step 3**: Calculate `mid` and apply the condition function.
4. **Step 4**: Adjust the `right` pointer if `mid^2` is greater than `x`, otherwise adjust the `left` pointer.
5. **Step 5**: Repeat the process until `left` is equal to `right`, then return `left - 1` as the integer square root.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(log x)
  - *The time complexity is logarithmic due to the binary search approach.*
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - *The space complexity is constant because no additional space is used.*

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        def condition(mid):
            return mid**2 > x
        if x == 1:
            return 1
        left, right = 1, x
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if condition(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left - 1
```

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
x = 4
Output: 2

# Test case 2
x = 8
Output: 2

# Test case 3
x = 1
Output: 1
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Linear Search
- Iteratively check each integer from 1 to `x` to find the largest `y` such that `y^2 <= x`.
- **Complexity**: O(x) Time | O(1) Space
- *This approach is much slower compared to binary search.*

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: 
  - Ensure the calculation of `mid` avoids overflow issues for large values of `x`.
  - Ensure you return `left-1` since the value of `left` when the exiting the while loop was the greatest least number that can be the root of x.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: Binary search is an efficient technique for finding thresholds in sorted or sequential data.
- **Related Problems**: Consider problems like "Find Peak Element" or other binary search problems for additional practice.
