# Solution to [Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

---

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution involves converting the integer to a string and checking if the string reads the same forwards and backwards.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Convert the integer to a string.
2. **Step 2**: Reverse the string.
3. **Step 3**: Compare the original string with the reversed string to check for equality.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The time complexity is linear with respect to the number of digits in the integer, as both the conversion to string and the reversal of the string take linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The space complexity is also linear due to the storage required for the string representation of the integer and its reversed version.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
                return str(x) == str(x)[::-1]
```

---

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = 121
Output = True

# Test case 2
parameters = -121
Output = False

# Test case 3
parameters = 10
Output = False

# Test case 4
parameters = 0
Output = True
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Without String Conversion

- Instead of converting the integer to a string, reverse the integer mathematically and compare it with the original integer.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Avoids the overhead of string conversion.
- Cons: More complex to implement.

### Alternative 2: Two-Pointer Technique

- Use two pointers to compare digits from the start and end of the number.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Efficient in terms of space.
- Cons: Requires careful handling of edge cases.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Negative numbers are not palindromes. Be cautious with leading zeros.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: Reversing a string in Python can be done using slicing: `str[::-1]`.
