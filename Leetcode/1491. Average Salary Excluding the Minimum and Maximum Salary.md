# Solution to [1491. Average Salary Excluding the Minimum and Maximum Salary](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-salary-excluding-the-minimum-and-maximum-salary/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

---

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea is to sort the salary list, exclude the minimum and maximum salaries, and then calculate the average of the remaining salaries.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Sort the salary list in ascending order.
2. **Step 2**: Initialize a variable to keep the total sum of the salaries excluding the first and last elements.
3. **Step 3**: Iterate through the sorted list from the second element to the second last element, adding each salary to the total sum.
4. **Step 4**: Calculate the average by dividing the total sum by the number of elements considered (total number of salaries minus 2).
5. **Step 5**: Return the calculated average.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
  - Sorting the list takes O(n log n) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution uses a constant amount of extra space.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def average(self, salary: List[int]) -> float:
                salary.sort()
                total = 0
                n = len(salary)
                for i in range(1, n-1):
                        total += salary[i]
                average = total / (n-2)
                return average
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [4000, 3000, 1000, 2000]
Output = 2500.0

# Test case 2
parameters = [6000, 5000, 4000, 3000, 2000, 1000]
Output = 3500.0
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Using Sum and Min/Max Functions

- Instead of sorting, find the sum of all elements and subtract the minimum and maximum salaries.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: More efficient in terms of time complexity.
- Cons: Slightly more complex to implement.

  ```python
  class Solution:
      def average(self, salary: List[int]) -> float:
          total = sum(salary) - min(salary) - max(salary)
          n = len(salary) - 2
          return total / n
  ```

### Alternative 2: Using List Comprehension

- Use list comprehension to filter out the minimum and maximum salaries and then calculate the average.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Concise and readable.
- Cons: Uses additional space for the filtered list.

  ```python
  class Solution:
      def average(self, salary: List[int]) -> float:
          n = len(salary)
          total = sum([x for x in salary if x != min(salary) and x != max(salary)])
          return total / (n - 2)
  ```

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the list has more than two elements to avoid division by zero.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The `min()` and `max()` functions can be used to find the minimum and maximum salaries efficiently.
