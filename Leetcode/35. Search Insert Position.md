# Solution to [Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)

---

## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy  

---

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The approach uses a binary search algorithm to efficiently find the target position in a sorted array. If the target is not present, it determines the correct insert position.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Initialize Pointers**: Set `left` to 0 and `right` to the length of the list `nums`.
2. **Binary Search Loop**: 
   - Calculate `mid` as the average of `left` and `right`.
   - If `nums[mid]` is greater than or equal to the target, update `right` to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, update `left` to `mid + 1`.
3. **Return Position**: Once the loop ends, `left` will be at the correct insert position for the target.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
  - The binary search algorithm halves the search space each iteration, resulting in logarithmic time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution uses a constant amount of additional space.

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(nums)
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if nums[mid] >= target:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
nums = [1, 3, 5, 6]
target = 5
Output = 2

# Test case 2
nums = [1, 3, 5, 6]
target = 2
Output = 1

# Test case 3
nums = [1, 3, 5, 6]
target = 7
Output = 4

# Test case 4
nums = [1, 3, 5, 6]
target = 0
Output = 0
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Linear Search
- Iterate through the list `nums` and find the first position where the element is greater than or equal to the target.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- This approach is less efficient than binary search for large lists.

### Alternative 2: Recursive Binary Search
- Using the bisect module in Python.
- **Complexity**: O(log n) Time | O(1) Space
- Same as the original but takes less time to write.
- **code**:
    ```python
    import bisect
    class Solution:
        def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
            return bisect.bisect_left(nums, target)
    ```

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the loop condition correctly terminates when `left` equals `right`.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: Using the bisect module would be easier to implement.
