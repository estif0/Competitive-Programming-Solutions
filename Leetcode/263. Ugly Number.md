# Solution to [263. Ugly Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The solution involves repeatedly dividing the given number by 2, 3, and 5. If the number can be reduced to 1 by these divisions, it is considered an ugly number.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Check if the number is less than or equal to 0. If so, return `False` because negative numbers and zero are not considered ugly numbers.
2. **Step 2**: Use a loop to divide the number by 2 as long as it is divisible by 2.
3. **Step 3**: Similarly, use loops to divide the number by 3 and 5 as long as it is divisible by these numbers.
4. **Step 4**: After all possible divisions, check if the number is reduced to 1. If yes, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

> **Example**: For the number 30, it will be divided by 2 to get 15, then by 3 to get 5, and finally by 5 to get 1, thus confirming it is an ugly number.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
  - The number of divisions is proportional to the logarithm of the number.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - No additional space is used apart from a few variables.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def isUgly(self, n: int) -> bool:
                if n <= 0:
                        return False
                while n % 2 == 0:
                        n //= 2
                while n % 3 == 0:
                        n //= 3
                while n % 5 == 0:
                        n //= 5
                return n == 1
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = 6
Output = True

# Test case 2
parameters = 8
Output = True

# Test case 3
parameters = 14
Output = False
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Description

- Use a recursive approach to divide the number by 2, 3, and 5.
- **Complexity**: O(log n) Time | O(log n) Space
- Pros: More intuitive for some; Cons: Higher space complexity due to recursion stack.

```python
class Solution:
        def isUgly(self, n: int) -> bool:
                if n <= 0:
                        return False
                if n == 1:
                        return True
                if n % 2 == 0:
                        return self.isUgly(n // 2)
                if n % 3 == 0:
                        return self.isUgly(n // 3)
                if n % 5 == 0:
                        return self.isUgly(n // 5)
                return False
```

### Alternative 2: Description

- Use a set of prime factors and check if all prime factors of the number are in the set {2, 3, 5}.
- **Complexity**: O(sqrt(n)) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Lower time complexity; Cons: Less intuitive for some.

```python
class Solution:
        def isUgly(self, n: int) -> bool:
                if n <= 0:
                        return False
                for p in [2, 3, 5]:
                        while n % p == 0:
                                n //= p
                return n == 1
```

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Forgetting to handle negative numbers and zero.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The approach can be extended to check for other sets of prime factors.
