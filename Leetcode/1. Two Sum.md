# Solution to [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

---

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Easy

---

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea behind the solution is to use a brute-force approach to check all possible pairs of numbers in the list to find the two numbers that add up to the target.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Initialize two pointers, `h` and `s`, to iterate through the list.
2. **Step 2**: Use nested loops to check each pair of numbers. The outer loop iterates with `h` from the start to the end of the list, and the inner loop iterates with `s` starting from `h + 1` to the end of the list.
3. **Step 3**: For each pair `(nums[h], nums[s])`, check if their sum equals the target. If it does, return the indices `[h, s]`.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2)
  - The solution uses nested loops to check each pair of numbers, resulting in a quadratic time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution uses a constant amount of extra space.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
                h, s = 0, 1
                n = len(nums)
                while h < n:
                        while s < n:
                                if nums[h] + nums[s] == target:
                                        return [h, s]
                                s += 1
                        h += 1
                        s = h + 1
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = ([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)
Output = [0, 1]

# Test case 2
parameters = ([3, 2, 4], 6)
Output = [1, 2]

# Test case 3
parameters = ([3, 3], 6)
Output = [0, 1]
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Hash Map

- Use a hash map to store the indices of the numbers as you iterate through the list. For each number, check if the complement (target - current number) exists in the hash map.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: More efficient in terms of time complexity.
- Cons: Requires additional space for the hash map.
  ```python
  class Solution:
      def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
          num_map = {}
          for i, num in enumerate(nums):
              complement = target - num
              if complement in num_map:
                  return [num_map[complement], i]
              num_map[num] = i
  ```

### Alternative 2: Two-Pointer Technique

- Sort the list and use two pointers to find the two numbers that add up to the target. This approach is not suitable if the problem requires returning the original indices.
- **Complexity**: O(n log n) Time | O(1) Space

  ```python
  class Solution:
      def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
          nums = sorted(enumerate(nums), key=lambda x: x[1])
          left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
          while left < right:
              total = nums[left][1] + nums[right][1]
              if total == target:
                  return [nums[left][0], nums[right][0]]
              elif total < target:
                  left += 1
              else:
                  right -= 1
  ```
