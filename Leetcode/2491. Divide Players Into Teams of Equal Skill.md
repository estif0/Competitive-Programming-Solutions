## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea is to sort the skill levels and then pair the smallest and largest values to form teams. By ensuring that the sum of skills for each pair is consistent, we can determine if it's possible to divide the players into teams of equal skill.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Sort the skill levels of the players.
2. **Step 2**: Initialize two pointers, `left` at the start and `right` at the end of the sorted list. Calculate the target sum using the first and last elements.
3. **Step 3**: Iterate through the list, checking if the sum of the current pair matches the target sum. If it does, add the product of the pair to the answer. If not, return -1.
4. **Step 4**: Continue this process until all pairs are checked. If all pairs match the target sum, return the accumulated answer.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
  - Sorting the list takes O(n log n) time, and the subsequent iteration through the list takes O(n) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution uses a constant amount of extra space.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def dividePlayers(self, skill: List[int]) -> int:
                skill.sort()
                left, right = 0, len(skill) - 1
                key = skill[left] + skill[right]
                ans = 0
                while left < right:
                        if key != skill[left] + skill[right]:
                                return -1
                        else:
                                ans += skill[left] * skill[right]
                                right -= 1
                                left += 1
                return ans
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output = 10

# Test case 2
parameters = [1, 1, 2, 2]
Output = 4

# Test case 3
parameters = [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output = -1
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Using a HashMap

- Use a hashmap to count the frequency of each skill level and then try to form pairs based on the counts.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Can handle cases where sorting is not feasible.
- Cons: More complex implementation and higher space usage.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the sum of skills for each pair is consistent. Watch out for edge cases where the number of players is odd.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: Sorting and two-pointer technique are useful for similar problems.
