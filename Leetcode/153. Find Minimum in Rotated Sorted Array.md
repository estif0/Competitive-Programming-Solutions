## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The problem requires finding the minimum element in a rotated sorted array. The main idea is to use a modified binary search to efficiently locate the minimum element.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Step 1**: Initialize two pointers, `left` at the start of the array and `right` at the end of the array.
2. **Step 2**: Use a while loop to perform binary search. Calculate the middle index `mid` and compare the middle element with the rightmost element to decide which half of the array to discard.
3. **Step 3**: If the middle element is less than the rightmost element, the minimum must be in the left half, so move the `right` pointer to `mid`. Otherwise, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
4. **Step 4**: Continue the process until `left` equals `right`, at which point `left` will be pointing to the minimum element.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
  - The binary search reduces the search space by half in each iteration, leading to a logarithmic time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution uses a constant amount of extra space.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                n = len(nums)
                def condition(mid, right):
                        return nums[mid] < nums[right]

                left, right = 0, n-1
                while left < right:
                        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
                        if condition(mid, right):
                                right = mid
                        else:
                                left = mid + 1
                return nums[left]
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
Output = 1

# Test case 2
parameters = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
Output = 0

# Test case 3
parameters = [11, 13, 15, 17]
Output = 11
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Linear Search

- A simple linear search can be used to find the minimum element by iterating through the entire array.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- _Pros_: Easy to implement.
- _Cons_: Inefficient for large arrays compared to binary search.
  ```python
  class Solution:
          def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                  return min(nums)
  ```

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the array is rotated and sorted. Handle edge cases where the array is not rotated.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The binary search technique is widely applicable to problems involving sorted arrays.
