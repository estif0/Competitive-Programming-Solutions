# Solution to [209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)

## Problem Details

**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Medium

## Solution Overview

### General Overview

The main idea is to use a sliding window approach to find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray whose sum is at least the target value. By expanding and contracting the window, we can efficiently find the solution.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Initialize Variables**: Start with `min_length` set to infinity, `start` index at 0, and `addition` to keep track of the current sum.
2. **Expand the Window**: Iterate through the array with the `end` index, adding the current element to `addition`.
3. **Contract the Window**: While `addition` is greater than or equal to the target, update `min_length` with the smaller value between `min_length` and the current window size (`end - start + 1`). Then, subtract the element at the `start` index from `addition` and increment `start`.
4. **Check Result**: If `min_length` remains infinity, return 0, indicating no valid subarray was found. Otherwise, return `min_length`.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The algorithm processes each element of the array at most twice (once when expanding the window and once when contracting it).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only a few extra variables are used, regardless of the input size.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
        def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                min_length = float("inf")
                start, addition = 0, 0
                for end in range(len(nums)):
                        addition += nums[end]
                        while addition >= target:
                                min_length = min(min_length, end - start + 1)
                                addition -= nums[start]
                                start += 1
                return 0 if min_length == float("inf") else min_length
```

## Test Cases

```python
# Test case 1
parameters = (7, [2,3,1,2,4,3])
Output = 2

# Test case 2
parameters = (4, [1,4,4])
Output = 1

# Test case 3
parameters = (11, [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1])
Output = 0
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Alternative 1: Binary Search Approach

- Use a prefix sum array and binary search to find the minimum subarray length.
- **Complexity**: O(n log n) Time | O(n) Space
- Pros: Can be more intuitive for some.
- Cons: Higher time complexity due to binary search.

## Additional Notes

- **Common Pitfalls**: Forgetting to update `min_length` or incorrectly managing the window size.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The sliding window technique is useful for many subarray problems.
