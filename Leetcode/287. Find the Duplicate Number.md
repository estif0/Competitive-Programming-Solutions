# Solution to [287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

---

## Problem Details
**Platform**: LeetCode  
**Difficulty**: Medium  

---

## Solution Overview
### General Overview
The main idea is to use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each number in the list. As we iterate through the list, we update the dictionary and check if any number appears more than once.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Step 1**: Initialize an empty dictionary `d` to store the frequency of each number.
2. **Step 2**: Iterate through the list `nums`. For each number, update its count in the dictionary.
3. **Step 3**: If the count of any number exceeds 1, return that number as the duplicate.

> **Example**: As we iterate through the list, we check the dictionary for the count of each number. If a number's count becomes greater than 1, we immediately return it.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
    - We iterate through the list once, performing constant-time operations for each element.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
    - We use a dictionary to store the frequency of each number, which in the worst case can store all n numbers.

## Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
        def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                d = {}
                for num in nums:
                        d[num] = d.get(num, 0) + 1
                        if d[num] > 1:
                                return num
```

## Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1
parameters = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]
Output = 2

# Test case 2
parameters = [3, 1, 3, 4, 2]
Output = 3
```

## Alternative Solutions
### Alternative 1: Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection)
- This approach uses two pointers to detect a cycle in the list, which corresponds to the duplicate number.
- **Complexity**: O(n) Time | O(1) Space
- Pros: Uses constant space.
- Cons: More complex to implement and understand.

## Additional Notes
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure that the input list contains at least one duplicate as per the problem constraints.
- **Useful Snippets/Information**: The dictionary approach is straightforward and easy to understand, making it a good choice for interviews.
